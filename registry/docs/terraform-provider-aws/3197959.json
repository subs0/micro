This must be an active listener on the load\nbalancer.\n* `cookie_name` - (Required) Application cookie whose lifetime the ELB's cookie should follow.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - ID of the policy.\n* `name` - Name of the stickiness policy.\n* `load_balancer` - Name of load balancer to which the policy is attached.\n* `lb_port` - Load balancer port to which the policy is applied.\n* `cookie_name` - Application cookie whose lifetime the ELB's cookie should follow.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import application cookie stickiness policies using the ELB name, port, and policy name separated by colons (`:`). For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_app_cookie_stickiness_policy.example\n  id = \"my-elb:80:my-policy\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import application cookie stickiness policies using the ELB name, port, and policy name separated by colons (`:`). For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_app_cookie_stickiness_policy.example my-elb:80:my-policy\n```\n",
