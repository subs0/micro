For example, `/dev/sda` or `/dev/xvdb`.\n    * `ebs` - Single list of object with Elastic Block Storage (EBS) block device mapping settings.\n        * `delete_on_termination` - Whether to delete the volume on termination. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.\n        * `encrypted` - Whether to encrypt the volume. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.\n        * `iops` - Number of Input/Output (I/O) operations per second to provision for an `io1` or `io2` volume.\n        * `kms_key_id` - ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key for encryption.\n        * `snapshot_id` - Identifier of the EC2 Volume Snapshot.\n        * `throughput` - For GP3 volumes only. The throughput in MiB/s that the volume supports.\n        * `volume_size` - Size of the volume, in GiB.\n        * `volume_type` - Type of the volume. For example, `gp2` or `io2`.\n    * `no_device` - Whether to remove a mapping from the parent image.\n    * `virtual_name` - Virtual device name. For example, `ephemeral0`. Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0.\n* `component` - List of objects with components for the image recipe.\n    * `component_arn` - ARN of the Image Builder Component.\n    * `parameter` - Set of parameters that are used to configure the component.\n        * `name` - Name of the component parameter.\n        * `value` - Value of the component parameter.\n* `date_created` - Date the image recipe was created.\n* `description` - Description of the image recipe.\n* `name` - Name of the image recipe.\n* `owner` - Owner of the image recipe.\n* `parent_image` - Base image of the image recipe.\n* `platform` - Platform of the image recipe.\n* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags for the image recipe.\n* `user_data_base64` - Base64 encoded contents of user data. Commands or a command script to run when build instance is launched.\n* `version` - Version of the image recipe.\n* `working_directory` - Working directory used during build and test workflows.\n",
