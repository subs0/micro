This can lead to a cyclical dependency on update, as Terraform will unsuccessfully attempt to destroy alarms before updating the rule. Consider using `depends_on`, references to alarm names, and two-stage updates.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm\" \"example\" {\n  alarm_description = \"This is a composite alarm!\"\n  alarm_name        = \"example-composite-alarm\"\n\n  alarm_actions = aws_sns_topic.example.arn\n  ok_actions    = aws_sns_topic.example.arn\n\n  alarm_rule = <<EOF\nALARM(${aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.alpha.alarm_name}) OR\nALARM(${aws_cloudwatch_metric_alarm.bravo.alarm_name})\nEOF\n\n  actions_suppressor {\n    alarm            = \"suppressor-alarm\"\n    extension_period = 10\n    wait_period      = 20\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\n* `actions_enabled` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Indicates whether actions should be executed during any changes to the alarm state of the composite alarm. Defaults to `true`.\n* `actions_suppressor` - (Optional) Actions will be suppressed if the suppressor alarm is in the ALARM state.\n    * `alarm` - (Required) Can be an AlarmName or an Amazon Resource Name (ARN) from an existing alarm.\n    * `extension_period` - (Required) The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits after suppressor alarm goes out of the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs its actions.\n    * `wait_period` - (Required) The maximum time in seconds that the composite alarm waits for the suppressor alarm to go into the `ALARM` state. After this time, the composite alarm performs its actions.\n* `alarm_actions` - (Optional) The set of actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the `ALARM` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an ARN. Up to 5 actions are allowed.\n* `alarm_description` - (Optional) The description for the composite alarm.\n* `alarm_name` - (Required) The name for the composite alarm. This name must be unique within the region.\n* `alarm_rule` - (Required) An expression that specifies which other alarms are to be evaluated to determine this composite alarm's state. For syntax, see [Creating a Composite Alarm](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/Create_Composite_Alarm.html). The maximum length is 10240 characters.\n* `insufficient_data_actions` - (Optional) The set of actions to execute when this alarm transitions to the `INSUFFICIENT_DATA` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an ARN. Up to 5 actions are allowed.\n* `ok_actions` - (Optional) The set of actions to execute when this alarm transitions to an `OK` state from any other state. Each action is specified as an ARN. Up to 5 actions are allowed.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to associate with the alarm. Up to 50 tags are allowed. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN of the composite alarm.\n* `id` - The ID of the composite alarm resource, which is equivalent to its `alarm_name`.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import a CloudWatch Composite Alarm using the `alarm_name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm.test\n  id = \"my-alarm\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import a CloudWatch Composite Alarm using the `alarm_name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_composite_alarm.test my-alarm\n```\n",
