Defaults to `true`.\n* `default_authentication_method` - (Optional) The default authentication method used for APNs Sandbox.\n  __NOTE__: Amazon Pinpoint uses this default for every APNs push notification that you send using the console.\n  You can override the default when you send a message programmatically using the Amazon Pinpoint API, the AWS CLI, or an AWS SDK.\n  If your default authentication type fails, Amazon Pinpoint doesn't attempt to use the other authentication type.\n\nOne of the following sets of credentials is also required.\n\nIf you choose to use __Certificate credentials__ you will have to provide:\n\n* `certificate` - (Required) The pem encoded TLS Certificate from Apple.\n* `private_key` - (Required) The Certificate Private Key file (ie. `.key` file).\n\nIf you choose to use __Key credentials__ you will have to provide:\n\n* `bundle_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your iOS app. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, choose App IDs in the Identifiers section, and choose your app.\n* `team_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your Apple developer account team. This value is provided on the Membership page.\n* `token_key` - (Required) The `.p8` file that you download from your Apple developer account when you create an authentication key.\n* `token_key_id` - (Required) The ID assigned to your signing key. To find this value, choose Certificates, IDs & Profiles, and choose your key in the Keys section.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports no additional attributes.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Pinpoint APNs Sandbox Channel using the `application-id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_pinpoint_apns_sandbox_channel.apns_sandbox\n  id = \"application-id\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Pinpoint APNs Sandbox Channel using the `application-id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_pinpoint_apns_sandbox_channel.apns_sandbox application-id\n```\n",
