The given filters must match exactly one\nLocal Gateway whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.\n\n* `id` - (Optional) Id of the specific Local Gateway to retrieve.\n\n* `state` - (Optional) Current state of the desired Local Gateway.\n  Can be either `\"pending\"` or `\"available\"`.\n\n* `tags` - (Optional) Mapping of tags, each pair of which must exactly match\n  a pair on the desired Local Gateway.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeLocalGateways.html).\n\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n  A Local Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nAll of the argument attributes except `filter` blocks are also exported as\nresult attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating\nany fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for\nthe selected Local Gateway.\n\nThe following attributes are additionally exported:\n\n* `outpost_arn` - ARN of Outpost\n* `owner_id` - AWS account identifier that owns the Local Gateway.\n* `state` - State of the local gateway.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
