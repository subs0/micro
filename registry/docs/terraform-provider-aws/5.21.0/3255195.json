Elastic Beanstalk allows\nyou to deploy and manage applications in the AWS cloud without worrying about\nthe infrastructure that runs those applications.\n\nThis resource creates an application that has one configuration template named\n`default`, and no application versions\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_elastic_beanstalk_application\" \"tftest\" {\n  name        = \"tf-test-name\"\n  description = \"tf-test-desc\"\n\n  appversion_lifecycle {\n    service_role          = aws_iam_role.beanstalk_service.arn\n    max_count             = 128\n    delete_source_from_s3 = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the application, must be unique within your account\n* `description` - (Optional) Short description of the application\n* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of tags for the Elastic Beanstalk Application. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\nApplication version lifecycle (`appversion_lifecycle`) supports the following settings.  Only one of either `max_count` or `max_age_in_days` can be provided:\n\n* `service_role` - (Required) The ARN of an IAM service role under which the application version is deleted.  Elastic Beanstalk must have permission to assume this role.\n* `max_count` - (Optional) The maximum number of application versions to retain ('max_age_in_days' and 'max_count' cannot be enabled simultaneously.).\n* `max_age_in_days` - (Optional) The number of days to retain an application version ('max_age_in_days' and 'max_count' cannot be enabled simultaneously.).\n* `delete_source_from_s3` - (Optional) Set to `true` to delete a version's source bundle from S3 when the application version is deleted.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN assigned by AWS for this Elastic Beanstalk Application.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Elastic Beanstalk Applications using the `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.tf_test\n  id = \"tf-test-name\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Elastic Beanstalk Applications using the `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_elastic_beanstalk_application.tf_test tf-test-name\n```\n",
