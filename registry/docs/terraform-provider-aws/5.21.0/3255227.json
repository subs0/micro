If you choose not to store these events, Evidently deletes them after using them to produce metrics and other experiment results that you can view. See below.\n* `description` - (Optional) Specifies the description of the project.\n* `name` - (Required) A name for the project.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the project. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\nThe `data_delivery` block supports the following arguments:\n\n~> **NOTE:** You can't specify both `cloudwatch_logs` and `s3_destination`.\n\n* `cloudwatch_logs` - (Optional) A block that defines the CloudWatch Log Group that stores the evaluation events. See below.\n* `s3_destination` - (Optional) A block that defines the S3 bucket and prefix that stores the evaluation events. See below.\n\nThe `cloudwatch_logs` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `log_group` - (Optional) The name of the log group where the project stores evaluation events.\n\nThe `s3_destination` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `bucket` - (Optional) The name of the bucket in which Evidently stores evaluation events.\n* `prefix` - (Optional) The bucket prefix in which Evidently stores evaluation events.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `2m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `2m`)\n* `update` - (Default `2m`)\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `active_experiment_count` - The number of ongoing experiments currently in the project.\n* `active_launch_count` - The number of ongoing launches currently in the project.\n* `arn` - The ARN of the project.\n* `created_time` - The date and time that the project is created.\n* `experiment_count` - The number of experiments currently in the project. This includes all experiments that have been created and not deleted, whether they are ongoing or not.\n* `feature_count` - The number of features currently in the project.\n* `id` - The ID has the same value as the arn of the project.\n* `last_updated_time` - The date and time that the project was most recently updated.\n* `launch_count` - The number of launches currently in the project. This includes all launches that have been created and not deleted, whether they are ongoing or not.\n* `status` - The current state of the project. Valid values are `AVAILABLE` and `UPDATING`.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Evidently Project using the `arn`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_evidently_project.example\n  id = \"arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:segment/example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Project using the `arn`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_evidently_project.example arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:segment/example\n```\n",
