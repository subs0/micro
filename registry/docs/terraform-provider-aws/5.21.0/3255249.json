See below.\n* `version` - (Optional) Version that is associated with this build.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n### Nested Fields\n\n#### `storage_location`\n\n* `bucket` - (Required) Name of your S3 bucket.\n* `key` - (Required) Name of the zip file containing your build files.\n* `role_arn` - (Required) ARN of the access role that allows Amazon GameLift to access your S3 bucket.\n* `object_version` - (Optional) A specific version of the file. If not set, the latest version of the file is retrieved.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - GameLift Build ID.\n* `arn` - GameLift Build ARN.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Builds using the ID. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_gamelift_build.example\n  id = \"<build-id>\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import GameLift Builds using the ID. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_gamelift_build.example <build-id>\n```\n",
