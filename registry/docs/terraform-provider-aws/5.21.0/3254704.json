The given filters must match exactly one\nVPC whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `ipam_pool_id` - ID of the IPAM pool you would like the list of provisioned CIDRs.\n* `filter` - Custom filter block as described below.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nAll of the argument attributes except `filter` blocks are also exported as\nresult attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating\nany fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for\nthe selected IPAM Pool CIDRs.\n\nThe following attribute is additionally exported:\n\n* `ipam_pool_cidrs` - The CIDRs provisioned into the IPAM pool, described below.\n\n### ipam_pool_cidrs\n\n* `cidr` - A network CIDR.\n* `state` - The provisioning state of that CIDR.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `1m`)\n",
