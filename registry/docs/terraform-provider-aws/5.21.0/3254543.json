The given filters must match exactly one\nNAT Gateway whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `id` - (Optional) ID of the specific NAT Gateway to retrieve.\n* `subnet_id` - (Optional) ID of subnet that the NAT Gateway resides in.\n* `vpc_id` - (Optional) ID of the VPC that the NAT Gateway resides in.\n* `state` - (Optional) State of the NAT Gateway (pending | failed | available | deleting | deleted ).\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match\n  a pair on the desired NAT Gateway.\n* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeNatGateways.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n  An Nat Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nAll of the argument attributes except `filter` block are also exported as\nresult attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating\nany fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for\nthe selected Nat Gateway.\n\n* `allocation_id` - ID of the EIP allocated to the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `association_id` - The association ID of the Elastic IP address that's associated with the NAT Gateway. Only available when `connectivity_type` is `public`.\n* `connectivity_type` - Connectivity type of the NAT Gateway.\n* `network_interface_id` - The ID of the ENI allocated to the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `private_ip` - Private IP address of the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `public_ip` - Public IP (EIP) address of the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `secondary_allocation_ids` - Secondary allocation EIP IDs for the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `secondary_private_ip_address_count` - The number of secondary private IPv4 addresses assigned to the selected NAT Gateway.\n* `secondary_private_ip_addresses` - Secondary private IPv4 addresses assigned to the selected NAT Gateway.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
