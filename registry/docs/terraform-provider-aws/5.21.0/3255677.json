For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_route53_traffic_policy_instance.test\n  id = \"df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Route53 traffic policy instance using its id. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_route53_traffic_policy_instance.test df579d9a-6396-410e-ac22-e7ad60cf9e7e\n```\n",
