The functionality is identical.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination\" \"test\" {\n  name                             = \"api-destination\"\n  description                      = \"An API Destination\"\n  invocation_endpoint              = \"https://api.destination.com/endpoint\"\n  http_method                      = \"POST\"\n  invocation_rate_limit_per_second = 20\n  connection_arn                   = aws_cloudwatch_event_connection.test.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the new API Destination. The name must be unique for your account. Maximum of 64 characters consisting of numbers, lower/upper case letters, .,-,_.\n* `description` - (Optional) The description of the new API Destination. Maximum of 512 characters.\n* `invocation_endpoint` - (Required) URL endpoint to invoke as a target. This could be a valid endpoint generated by a partner service. You can include \"*\" as path parameters wildcards to be set from the Target HttpParameters.\n* `http_method` - (Required) Select the HTTP method used for the invocation endpoint, such as GET, POST, PUT, etc.\n* `invocation_rate_limit_per_second` - (Optional) Enter the maximum number of invocations per second to allow for this destination. Enter a value greater than 0 (default 300).\n* `connection_arn` - (Required) ARN of the EventBridge Connection to use for the API Destination.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event API Destination.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination.test\n  id = \"api-destination\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import EventBridge API Destinations using the `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_api_destination.test api-destination\n```\n",
