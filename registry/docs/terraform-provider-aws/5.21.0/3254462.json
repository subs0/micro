For example, `/dev/sda` or `/dev/xvdb`.\n        * `ebs` - Single list of object with Elastic Block Storage (EBS) block device mapping settings.\n            * `delete_on_termination` - Whether to delete the volume on termination. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.\n            * `encrypted` - Whether to encrypt the volume. Defaults to unset, which is the value inherited from the parent image.\n            * `iops` - Number of Input/Output (I/O) operations per second to provision for an `io1` or `io2` volume.\n            * `kms_key_id` - ARN of the Key Management Service (KMS) Key for encryption.\n            * `snapshot_id` - Identifier of the EC2 Volume Snapshot.\n            * `throughput` - For GP3 volumes only. The throughput in MiB/s that the volume supports.\n            * `volume_size` - Size of the volume, in GiB.\n            * `volume_type` - Type of the volume. For example, `gp2` or `io2`.\n        * `no_device` - Whether to remove a mapping from the parent image.\n        * `virtual_name` - Virtual device name. For example, `ephemeral0`. Instance store volumes are numbered starting from 0.\n    * `image` - AMI ID of the base image for container build and test instance.\n* `kms_key_id` - KMS key used to encrypt the container image.\n* `name` - Name of the container recipe.\n* `owner` - Owner of the container recipe.\n* `parent_image` - Base image for the container recipe.\n* `platform` - Platform of the container recipe.\n* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags for the container recipe.\n* `target_repository` - Destination repository for the container image.\n    * `repository_name` - Name of the container repository where the output container image is stored. The name is prefixed by the repository location.\n    * `service` - Service in which this image is registered.\n* `version` - Version of the container recipe.\n* `working_directory` - Working directory used during build and test workflows.\n",
