Creating this resource causes the source EFS file system to be replicated to a new read-only destination EFS file system. Deleting this resource will cause the replication from source to destination to stop and the destination file system will no longer be read only.\n\n~> **NOTE:** Deleting this resource does **not** delete the destination file system that was created.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nWill create a replica using regional storage in us-west-2 that will be encrypted by the default EFS KMS key `/aws/elasticfilesystem`.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_efs_file_system\" \"example\" {}\n\nresource \"aws_efs_replication_configuration\" \"example\" {\n  source_file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.example.id\n\n  destination {\n    region = \"us-west-2\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nReplica will be created as One Zone storage in the us-west-2b Availability Zone and encrypted with the specified KMS key.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_efs_file_system\" \"example\" {}\n\nresource \"aws_efs_replication_configuration\" \"example\" {\n  source_file_system_id = aws_efs_file_system.example.id\n\n  destination {\n    availability_zone_name = \"us-west-2b\"\n    kms_key_id             = \"1234abcd-12ab-34cd-56ef-1234567890ab\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `source_file_system_id` - (Required) The ID of the file system that is to be replicated.\n* `destination` - (Required) A destination configuration block (documented below).\n\n### Destination Arguments\n\n`destination` supports the following arguments:\n\n* `availability_zone_name` - (Optional) The availability zone in which the replica should be created. If specified, the replica will be created with One Zone storage. If omitted, regional storage will be used.\n* `kms_key_id` - (Optional) The Key ID, ARN, alias, or alias ARN of the KMS key that should be used to encrypt the replica file system. If omitted, the default KMS key for EFS `/aws/elasticfilesystem` will be used.\n* `region` - (Optional) The region in which the replica should be created.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `creation_time` - When the replication configuration was created.\n* `original_source_file_system_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the original source Amazon EFS file system in the replication configuration.\n* `source_file_system_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the current source file system in the replication configuration.\n* `source_file_system_region` - The AWS Region in which the source Amazon EFS file system is located.\n* `destination[0].file_system_id` - The fs ID of the replica.\n* `destination[0].status` - The status of the replication.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `10m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `20m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EFS Replication Configurations using the file system ID of either the source or destination file system. When importing, the `availability_zone_name` and `kms_key_id` attributes must **not** be set in the configuration. The AWS API does not return these values when querying the replication configuration and their presence will therefore show as a diff in a subsequent plan. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_efs_replication_configuration.example\n  id = \"fs-id\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import EFS Replication Configurations using the file system ID of either the source or destination file system. When importing, the `availability_zone_name` and `kms_key_id` attributes must **not** be set in the configuration. The AWS API does not return these values when querying the replication configuration and their presence will therefore show as a diff in a subsequent plan. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_efs_replication_configuration.example fs-id\n```\n",
