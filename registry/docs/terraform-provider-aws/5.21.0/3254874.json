Budgets use the cost visualisation provided by Cost Explorer to show you the status of your budgets, to provide forecasts of your estimated costs, and to track your AWS usage, including your free tier usage.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"ec2\" {\n  name              = \"budget-ec2-monthly\"\n  budget_type       = \"COST\"\n  limit_amount      = \"1200\"\n  limit_unit        = \"USD\"\n  time_period_end   = \"2087-06-15_00:00\"\n  time_period_start = \"2017-07-01_00:00\"\n  time_unit         = \"MONTHLY\"\n\n  cost_filter {\n    name = \"Service\"\n    values = [\n      \"Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud - Compute\",\n    ]\n  }\n\n  notification {\n    comparison_operator        = \"GREATER_THAN\"\n    threshold                  = 100\n    threshold_type             = \"PERCENTAGE\"\n    notification_type          = \"FORECASTED\"\n    subscriber_email_addresses = [\"test@example.com\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a budget for *$100*.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"cost\" {\n  # ...\n  budget_type  = \"COST\"\n  limit_amount = \"100\"\n  limit_unit   = \"USD\"\n}\n```\n\nCreate a budget with planned budget limits.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"cost\" {\n  # ...\n\n  planned_limit {\n    start_time = \"2017-07-01_00:00\"\n    amount     = \"100\"\n    unit       = \"USD\"\n  }\n\n  planned_limit {\n    start_time = \"2017-08-01_00:00\"\n    amount     = \"200\"\n    unit       = \"USD\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a budget for s3 with a limit of *3 GB* of storage.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"s3\" {\n  # ...\n  budget_type  = \"USAGE\"\n  limit_amount = \"3\"\n  limit_unit   = \"GB\"\n}\n```\n\nCreate a Savings Plan Utilization Budget\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"savings_plan_utilization\" {\n  # ...\n  budget_type  = \"SAVINGS_PLANS_UTILIZATION\"\n  limit_amount = \"100.0\"\n  limit_unit   = \"PERCENTAGE\"\n\n  cost_types {\n    include_credit             = false\n    include_discount           = false\n    include_other_subscription = false\n    include_recurring          = false\n    include_refund             = false\n    include_subscription       = true\n    include_support            = false\n    include_tax                = false\n    include_upfront            = false\n    use_blended                = false\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a RI Utilization Budget\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"ri_utilization\" {\n  # ...\n  budget_type  = \"RI_UTILIZATION\"\n  limit_amount = \"100.0\" # RI utilization must be 100\n  limit_unit   = \"PERCENTAGE\"\n\n  #Cost types must be defined for RI budgets because the settings conflict with the defaults\n  cost_types {\n    include_credit             = false\n    include_discount           = false\n    include_other_subscription = false\n    include_recurring          = false\n    include_refund             = false\n    include_subscription       = true\n    include_support            = false\n    include_tax                = false\n    include_upfront            = false\n    use_blended                = false\n  }\n\n  # RI Utilization plans require a service cost filter to be set\n  cost_filter {\n    name = \"Service\"\n    values = [\n      \"Amazon Relational Database Service\",\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a Cost Filter using Resource Tags\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"cost\" {\n  # ...\n  cost_filter {\n    name = \"TagKeyValue\"\n    values = [\n      \"TagKey$TagValue\",\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nCreate a cost_filter using resource tags, obtaining the tag value from a terraform variable\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_budgets_budget\" \"cost\" {\n  # ...\n  cost_filter {\n    name = \"TagKeyValue\"\n    values = [\n      \"TagKey${\"$\"}${var.TagValue}\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nFor more detailed documentation about each argument, refer to the [AWS official\ndocumentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/data-type-budget.html).\n\nThis argument supports the following arguments:\n\n* `account_id` - (Optional) The ID of the target account for budget.

See [Spend](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/awsaccountbilling/latest/aboutv2/data-type-spend.html) documentation.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import budgets using `AccountID:ActionID:BudgetName`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_budgets_budget.myBudget\n  id = \"123456789012:myBudget\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import budgets using `AccountID:ActionID:BudgetName`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_budgets_budget.myBudget 123456789012:myBudget\n```\n",
