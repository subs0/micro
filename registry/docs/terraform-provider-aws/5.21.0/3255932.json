IPAM Resource Discoveries are resources meant for multi-organization customers. If you wish to use a single IPAM across multiple orgs, a resource discovery can be created and shared from a subordinate organization to the management organizations IPAM delegated admin account.\n\nOnce an association is created between two organizations via IPAM & a IPAM Resource Discovery, IPAM Pools can be shared via Resource Access Manager (RAM) to accounts in the subordinate organization; these RAM shares must be accepted by the end user account. Pools can then also discover and monitor IPAM resources in the subordinate organization.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_vpc_ipam_resource_discovery_association\" \"test\" {\n  ipam_id                    = aws_vpc_ipam.test.id\n  ipam_resource_discovery_id = aws_vpc_ipam_resource_discovery.test.id\n\n  tags = {\n    \"Name\" = \"test\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `ipam_id` - (Required) The ID of the IPAM to associate.\n* `ipam_resource_discovery_id` - (Required) The ID of the Resource Discovery to associate.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to add to the IPAM resource discovery association resource.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of IPAM Resource Discovery Association.\n* `id` - The ID of the IPAM Resource Discovery Association.\n* `owner_id` - The account ID for the account that manages the Resource Discovery\n* `ipam_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the IPAM.\n* `ipam_region` - The home region of the IPAM.\n* `is_default` - A boolean to identify if the Resource Discovery is the accounts default resource discovery.\n* `state` - The lifecycle state of the association when you associate or disassociate a resource discovery.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import IPAMs using the IPAM resource discovery association `id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_vpc_ipam_resource_discovery_association.example\n  id = \"ipam-res-disco-assoc-0178368ad2146a492\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import IPAMs using the IPAM resource discovery association `id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_vpc_ipam_resource_discovery_association.example ipam-res-disco-assoc-0178368ad2146a492\n```\n",
