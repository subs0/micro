The name of the Amazon CloudWatch Logs log group must begin with the `/aws/fsx` prefix. The name of the Amazon Kinesis Data Firehouse delivery stream must begin with the `aws-fsx` prefix. If you do not provide a destination in `audit_log_destionation`, Amazon FSx will create and use a log stream in the CloudWatch Logs /aws/fsx/windows log group.\n* `file_access_audit_log_level` - (Optional) Sets which attempt type is logged by Amazon FSx for file and folder accesses. Valid values are `SUCCESS_ONLY`, `FAILURE_ONLY`, `SUCCESS_AND_FAILURE`, and `DISABLED`.

For `SINGLE_AZ_1` deployment types, this is the DNS name of the file system.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n* `vpc_id` - Identifier of the Virtual Private Cloud for the file system.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `45m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `30m`)\n* `update` - (Default `45m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_fsx_windows_file_system.example\n  id = \"fs-543ab12b1ca672f33\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import FSx File Systems using the `id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_fsx_windows_file_system.example fs-543ab12b1ca672f33\n```\n\nCertain resource arguments, like `security_group_ids` and the `self_managed_active_directory` configuation block `password`, do not have a FSx API method for reading the information after creation. If these arguments are set in the Terraform configuration on an imported resource, Terraform will always show a difference. To workaround this behavior, either omit the argument from the Terraform configuration or use [`ignore_changes`](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/meta-arguments/lifecycle.html#ignore_changes) to hide the difference. For example:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_fsx_windows_file_system\" \"example\" {\n  # ... other configuration ...\n\n  security_group_ids = [aws_security_group.example.id]\n\n  # There is no FSx API for reading security_group_ids\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes = [security_group_ids]\n  }\n}\n```\n",
