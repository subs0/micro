See [Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms][beanstalk-platforms] from\nAWS documentation for reference solution stack names.\n\n~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search,\nTerraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return\na single solution stack, or use `most_recent` to choose the most recent one.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `name` - Name of the solution stack.\n\n[beanstalk-platforms]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/latest/dg/concepts.platforms.html \"AWS Elastic Beanstalk Supported Platforms documentation\"\n",
