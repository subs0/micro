See [Platform][1] for supported platforms.\n* `platform_credential` - (Required) Application Platform credential. See [Credential][1] for type of credential required for platform. The value of this attribute when stored into the Terraform state is only a hash of the real value, so therefore it is not practical to use this as an attribute for other resources.\n* `event_delivery_failure_topic_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the SNS Topic triggered when a delivery to any of the platform endpoints associated with your platform application encounters a permanent failure.\n* `event_endpoint_created_topic_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the SNS Topic triggered when a new platform endpoint is added to your platform application.\n* `event_endpoint_deleted_topic_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the SNS Topic triggered when an existing platform endpoint is deleted from your platform application.\n* `event_endpoint_updated_topic_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the SNS Topic triggered when an existing platform endpoint is changed from your platform application.\n* `failure_feedback_role_arn` - (Optional) The IAM role ARN permitted to receive failure feedback for this application and give SNS write access to use CloudWatch logs on your behalf.\n* `platform_principal` - (Optional) Application Platform principal. See [Principal][2] for type of principal required for platform. The value of this attribute when stored into the Terraform state is only a hash of the real value, so therefore it is not practical to use this as an attribute for other resources.\n* `success_feedback_role_arn` - (Optional) The IAM role ARN permitted to receive success feedback for this application and give SNS write access to use CloudWatch logs on your behalf.\n* `success_feedback_sample_rate` - (Optional) The sample rate percentage (0-100) of successfully delivered messages.\n\nThe following attributes are needed only when using APNS token credentials:\n\n* `apple_platform_team_id` - (Required) The identifier that's assigned to your Apple developer account team. Must be 10 alphanumeric characters.\n* `apple_platform_bundle_id` - (Required) The bundle identifier that's assigned to your iOS app. May only include alphanumeric characters, hyphens (-), and periods (.).\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ARN of the SNS platform application\n* `arn` - The ARN of the SNS platform application\n\n[1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/dg/mobile-push-send-register.html\n[2]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/sns/latest/api/API_CreatePlatformApplication.html\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SNS platform applications using the ARN. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_sns_platform_application.gcm_application\n  id = \"arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:app/GCM/gcm_application\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import SNS platform applications using the ARN. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_sns_platform_application.gcm_application arn:aws:sns:us-west-2:0123456789012:app/GCM/gcm_application\n```\n",
