See [Parameters In Cache Key And Forwarded To Origin](#parameters-in-cache-key-and-forwarded-to-origin) for more information.\n\n### Parameters In Cache Key And Forwarded To Origin\n\n* `cookies_config` - Object that determines whether any cookies in viewer requests (and if so, which cookies) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. See [Cookies Config](#cookies-config) for more information.\n* `headers_config` - Object that determines whether any HTTP headers (and if so, which headers) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. See [Headers Config](#headers-config) for more information.\n* `query_strings_config` - Object that determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests (and if so, which query strings) are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin.

See [Items](#items) for more information.\n\n### Query String Config\n\n* `query_string_behavior` - Determines whether any URL query strings in viewer requests are included in the cache key and automatically included in requests that CloudFront sends to the origin. Valid values are `none`, `whitelist`, `allExcept`, `all`.\n* `query_strings` - Object that contains a list of query string names. See [Items](#items) for more information.\n\n### Items\n\n* `items` - List of item names (`cookies`, `headers`, or `query_strings`).\n",
