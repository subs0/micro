The functionality is identical.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_bus\" \"order\" {\n  name = \"orders\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_archive\" \"order\" {\n  name             = \"order-archive\"\n  event_source_arn = aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.order.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Example all optional arguments\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_bus\" \"order\" {\n  name = \"orders\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_archive\" \"order\" {\n  name             = \"order-archive\"\n  description      = \"Archived events from order service\"\n  event_source_arn = aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.order.arn\n  retention_days   = 7\n  event_pattern = jsonencode({\n    source = [\"company.team.order\"]\n  })\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the new event archive. The archive name cannot exceed 48 characters.\n* `event_source_arn` - (Required) Event bus source ARN from where these events should be archived.\n* `description` - (Optional) The description of the new event archive.\n* `event_pattern` - (Optional) Instructs the new event archive to only capture events matched by this pattern. By default, it attempts to archive every event received in the `event_source_arn`.\n* `retention_days` - (Optional) The maximum number of days to retain events in the new event archive. By default, it archives indefinitely.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the event archive.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import an EventBridge archive using the `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloudwatch_event_archive.imported_event_archive.test\n  id = \"order-archive\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import an EventBridge archive using the `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_archive.imported_event_archive order-archive\n```\n",
