You can use this parameter only if the `include_compliance_details` argument is also set to `true`.\n* `include_compliance_details` - (Optional) Specifies whether to include details regarding the compliance with the effective tag policy.\n* `tag_filter` - (Optional) Specifies a list of Tag Filters (keys and values) to restrict the output to only those resources that have the specified tag and, if included, the specified value. See [Tag Filter](#tag-filter) below. Conflicts with `resource_arn_list`.\n* `resource_type_filters` - (Optional) Constraints on the resources that you want returned. The format of each resource type is `service:resourceType`. For example, specifying a resource type of `ec2` returns all Amazon EC2 resources (which includes EC2 instances). Specifying a resource type of `ec2:instance` returns only EC2 instances.\n* `resource_arn_list` - (Optional) Specifies a list of ARNs of resources for which you want to retrieve tag data. Conflicts with `filter`.\n\n### Tag Filter\n\nA `tag_filter` block supports the following arguments:\n\nIf you do specify `tag_filter`, the response returns only those resources that are currently associated with the specified tag.\nIf you don't specify a `tag_filter`, the response includes all resources that were ever associated with tags. Resources that currently don't have associated tags are shown with an empty tag set.\n\n* `key` - (Required) One part of a key-value pair that makes up a tag.\n* `values` - (Optional) Optional part of a key-value pair that make up a tag.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `resource_tag_mapping_list` - List of objects matching the search criteria.\n    * `compliance_details` - List of objects with information that shows whether a resource is compliant with the effective tag policy, including details on any noncompliant tag keys.\n        * `compliance_status` - Whether the resource is compliant.\n        * `keys_with_noncompliant_values ` - Set of tag keys with non-compliant tag values.\n        * `non_compliant_keys ` - Set of non-compliant tag keys.\n    * `resource_arn` - ARN of the resource.\n    * `tags` - Map of tags assigned to the resource.\n",
