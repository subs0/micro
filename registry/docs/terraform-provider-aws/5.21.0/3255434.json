Follows the format us-east-2a (case-sensitive).\n* `region_name` - The AWS Region name.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `60m`)\n* `update` - (Default `180m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `90m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lightsail Distribution using the `id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_lightsail_distribution.example\n  id = \"rft-8012925589\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Lightsail Distribution using the `id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_lightsail_distribution.example rft-8012925589\n```\n",
