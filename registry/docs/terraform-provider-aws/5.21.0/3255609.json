Depending if [RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/ram/latest/userguide/getting-started-sharing.html#getting-started-sharing-orgs), the RAM behavior with different principal types changes.\n\nWhen RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is enabled:\n\n- For AWS Account ID, Organization, and Organizational Unit principals within the same AWS Organization, no resource share invitation is sent and resources become available automatically after creating the association.\n- For AWS Account ID principals outside the AWS Organization, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.\n\nWhen RAM Sharing with AWS Organizations is not enabled:\n\n- Organization and Organizational Unit principals cannot be used.\n- For AWS Account ID principals, a resource share invitation is sent and must be accepted before resources become available. See the [`aws_ram_resource_share_accepter` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/ram_resource_share_accepter.html) to accept these invitations.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### AWS Account ID\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_ram_resource_share\" \"example\" {\n  # ... other configuration ...\n  allow_external_principals = true\n}\n\nresource \"aws_ram_principal_association\" \"example\" {\n  principal          = \"111111111111\"\n  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn\n}\n```\n\n### AWS Organization\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_ram_principal_association\" \"example\" {\n  principal          = aws_organizations_organization.example.arn\n  resource_share_arn = aws_ram_resource_share.example.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `principal` - (Required) The principal to associate with the resource share. Possible values are an AWS account ID, an AWS Organizations Organization ARN, or an AWS Organizations Organization Unit ARN.\n* `resource_share_arn` - (Required) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource share.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Resource Share and the principal, separated by a comma.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_ram_principal_association.example\n  id = \"arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import RAM Principal Associations using their Resource Share ARN and the `principal` separated by a comma. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_ram_principal_association.example arn:aws:ram:eu-west-1:123456789012:resource-share/73da1ab9-b94a-4ba3-8eb4-45917f7f4b12,123456789012\n```\n",
