This allows instances to be created, updated, and deleted. Instances also support provisioning.\n---\n\n# Resource: aws_instance\n\nProvides an EC2 instance resource. This allows instances to be created, updated, and deleted. Instances also support [provisioning](https://www.terraform.io/docs/provisioners/index.html).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Basic example using AMI lookup\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"ubuntu\" {\n  most_recent = true\n\n  filter {\n    name   = \"name\"\n    values = [\"ubuntu/images/hvm-ssd/ubuntu-focal-20.04-amd64-server-*\"]\n  }\n\n  filter {\n    name   = \"virtualization-type\"\n    values = [\"hvm\"]\n  }\n\n  owners = [\"099720109477\"] # Canonical\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"web\" {\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id\n  instance_type = \"t3.micro\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"HelloWorld\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Spot instance example\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"this\" {\n  most_recent = true\n  owners      = [\"amazon\"]\n  filter {\n    name   = \"architecture\"\n    values = [\"arm64\"]\n  }\n  filter {\n    name   = \"name\"\n    values = [\"al2023-ami-2023*\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"this\" {\n  ami = data.aws_ami.this.id\n  instance_market_options {\n    spot_options {\n      max_price = 0.0031\n    }\n  }\n  instance_type = \"t4g.nano\"\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"test-spot\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Network and credit specification example\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"my_vpc\" {\n  cidr_block = \"172.16.0.0/16\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"tf-example\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"my_subnet\" {\n  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.my_vpc.id\n  cidr_block        = \"172.16.10.0/24\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-west-2a\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"tf-example\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_network_interface\" \"foo\" {\n  subnet_id   = aws_subnet.my_subnet.id\n  private_ips = [\"172.16.10.100\"]\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"primary_network_interface\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"foo\" {\n  ami           = \"ami-005e54dee72cc1d00\" # us-west-2\n  instance_type = \"t2.micro\"\n\n  network_interface {\n    network_interface_id = aws_network_interface.foo.id\n    device_index         = 0\n  }\n\n  credit_specification {\n    cpu_credits = \"unlimited\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### CPU options example\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"example\" {\n  cidr_block = \"172.16.0.0/16\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"tf-example\"\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"example\" {\n  vpc_id            = aws_vpc.example.id\n  cidr_block        = \"172.16.10.0/24\"\n  availability_zone = \"us-east-2a\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"tf-example\"\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"aws_ami\" \"amzn-linux-2023-ami\" {\n  most_recent = true\n  owners      = [\"amazon\"]\n\n  filter {\n    name   = \"name\"\n    values = [\"al2023-ami-2023.*-x86_64\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"example\" {\n  ami           = data.aws_ami.amzn-linux-2023-ami.id\n  instance_type = \"c6a.2xlarge\"\n  subnet_id     = aws_subnet.example.id\n\n  cpu_options {\n    core_count       = 2\n    threads_per_core = 2\n  }\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"tf-example\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Host resource group or Licence Manager registered AMI example\n\nA host resource group is a collection of Dedicated Hosts that you can manage as a single entity. As you launch instances, License Manager allocates the hosts and launches instances on them based on the settings that you configured. You can add existing Dedicated Hosts to a host resource group and take advantage of automated host management through License Manager.\n\n-> **NOTE:** A dedicated host is automatically associated with a License Manager host resource group if **Allocate hosts automatically** is enabled. Otherwise, use the `host_resource_group_arn` argument to explicitly associate the instance with the host resource group.\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_instance\" \"this\" {\n  ami                     = \"ami-0dcc1e21636832c5d\"\n  instance_type           = \"m5.large\"\n  host_resource_group_arn = \"arn:aws:resource-groups:us-west-2:012345678901:group/win-testhost\"\n  tenancy                 = \"host\"\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `ami` - (Optional) AMI to use for the instance.

An instance with a tenancy of `dedicated` runs on single-tenant hardware. The `host` tenancy is not supported for the import-instance command. Valid values are `default`, `dedicated`, and `host`.\n* `user_data` - (Optional) User data to provide when launching the instance. Do not pass gzip-compressed data via this argument; see `user_data_base64` instead. Updates to this field will trigger a stop/start of the EC2 instance by default. If the `user_data_replace_on_change` is set then updates to this field will trigger a destroy and recreate.\n* `user_data_base64` - (Optional) Can be used instead of `user_data` to pass base64-encoded binary data directly. Use this instead of `user_data` whenever the value is not a valid UTF-8 string. For example, gzip-encoded user data must be base64-encoded and passed via this argument to avoid corruption. Updates to this field will trigger a stop/start of the EC2 instance by default. If the `user_data_replace_on_change` is set then updates to this field will trigger a destroy and recreate.\n* `user_data_replace_on_change` - (Optional) When used in combination with `user_data` or `user_data_base64` will trigger a destroy and recreate when set to `true`. Defaults to `false` if not set.\n* `volume_tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign, at instance-creation time, to root and EBS volumes.\n\n~> **NOTE:** Do not use `volume_tags` if you plan to manage block device tags outside the `aws_instance` configuration, such as using `tags` in an [`aws_ebs_volume`](/docs/providers/aws/r/ebs_volume.html) resource attached via [`aws_volume_attachment`](/docs/providers/aws/r/volume_attachment.html). Doing so will result in resource cycling and inconsistent behavior.\n\n* `vpc_security_group_ids` - (Optional, VPC only) List of security group IDs to associate with.\n\n### Capacity Reservation Specification\n\n~> **NOTE:** You can specify only one argument at a time. If you specify both `capacity_reservation_preference` and `capacity_reservation_target`, the request fails. Modifying `capacity_reservation_preference` or `capacity_reservation_target` in this block requires the instance to be in `stopped` state.\n\nCapacity reservation specification can be applied/modified to the EC2 Instance at creation time or when the instance is `stopped`.\n\nThe `capacity_reservation_specification` block supports the following:\n\n* `capacity_reservation_preference` - (Optional) Indicates the instance's Capacity Reservation preferences.

Valid values include `standard` or `unlimited`. T3 instances are launched as unlimited by default. T2 instances are launched as standard by default.\n\n### EBS, Ephemeral, and Root Block Devices\n\nEach of the `*_block_device` attributes control a portion of the EC2 Instance's \"Block Device Mapping\". For more information, see the [AWS Block Device Mapping documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/block-device-mapping-concepts.html).\n\nThe `root_block_device` block supports the following:\n\n* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether the volume should be destroyed on instance termination. Defaults to `true`.\n* `encrypted` - (Optional) Whether to enable volume encryption. Defaults to `false`. Must be configured to perform drift detection.\n* `iops` - (Optional) Amount of provisioned [IOPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ebs-io-characteristics.html).

Defaults to `gp2`.\n\n~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `ebs_block_device` configuration of _existing_ resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes and attachments of an EBS block to an instance, use the `aws_ebs_volume` and `aws_volume_attachment` resources instead. If you use `ebs_block_device` on an `aws_instance`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of non-root EBS block devices for the instance, treating additional block devices as drift. For this reason, `ebs_block_device` cannot be mixed with external `aws_ebs_volume` and `aws_volume_attachment` resources for a given instance.\n\nEach `ephemeral_block_device` block supports the following:\n\n* `device_name` - Name of the block device to mount on the instance.\n* `no_device` - (Optional) Suppresses the specified device included in the AMI's block device mapping.\n* `virtual_name` - (Optional) [Instance Store Device Name](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#InstanceStoreDeviceNames) (e.g., `ephemeral0`).\n\nEach AWS Instance type has a different set of Instance Store block devices available for attachment. AWS [publishes a list](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/InstanceStorage.html#StorageOnInstanceTypes) of which ephemeral devices are available on each type. The devices are always identified by the `virtual_name` in the format `ephemeral{0..N}`.\n\n### Enclave Options\n\n-> **NOTE:** Changing `enabled` will cause the resource to be destroyed and re-created.\n\nEnclave options apply to the instance at boot time.\n\nThe `enclave_options` block supports the following:\n\n* `enabled` - (Optional) Whether Nitro Enclaves will be enabled on the instance. Defaults to `false`.\n\nFor more information, see the documentation on [Nitro Enclaves](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/enclaves/latest/user/nitro-enclave.html).\n\n### Maintenance Options\n\nThe `maintenance_options` block supports the following:\n\n* `auto_recovery` - (Optional) Automatic recovery behavior of the Instance.

Valid values include `optional` or `required`. Defaults to `optional`.\n* `instance_metadata_tags` - (Optional) Enables or disables access to instance tags from the instance metadata service. Valid values include `enabled` or `disabled`. Defaults to `disabled`.\n\nFor more information, see the documentation on the [Instance Metadata Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-metadata.html).\n\n### Network Interfaces\n\nEach of the `network_interface` blocks attach a network interface to an EC2 Instance during boot time. However, because the network interface is attached at boot-time, replacing/modifying the network interface **WILL** trigger a recreation of the EC2 Instance. If you should need at any point to detach/modify/re-attach a network interface to the instance, use the `aws_network_interface` or `aws_network_interface_attachment` resources instead.\n\nThe `network_interface` configuration block _does_, however, allow users to supply their own network interface to be used as the default network interface on an EC2 Instance, attached at `eth0`.\n\nEach `network_interface` block supports the following:\n\n* `delete_on_termination` - (Optional) Whether or not to delete the network interface on instance termination. Defaults to `false`. Currently, the only valid value is `false`, as this is only supported when creating new network interfaces when launching an instance.\n* `device_index` - (Required) Integer index of the network interface attachment. Limited by instance type.\n* `network_card_index` - (Optional) Integer index of the network card. Limited by instance type.

For IPv4 only subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance IPv4 address. For IPv6 native subnets, an instance DNS name must be based on the instance ID. For dual-stack subnets, you can specify whether DNS names use the instance IPv4 address or the instance ID. Valid values: `ip-name` and `resource-name`.\n\n### Spot Options\n\nThe `spot_options` block supports the following:\n\n* `instance_interruption_behavior` - (Optional) The behavior when a Spot Instance is interrupted. Valid values include `hibernate`, `stop`, `terminate` . The default is `terminate`.\n* `max_price` - (Optional) The maximum hourly price that you're willing to pay for a Spot Instance.\n* `spot_instance_type` - (Optional) The Spot Instance request type.

The default is `one-time`.\n* `valid_until` - (Optional) The end date of the request, in UTC format (YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). Supported only for persistent requests.\n\n### Launch Template Specification\n\n-> **Note:** Launch Template parameters will be used only once during instance creation. If you want to update existing instance you need to change parameters\ndirectly. Updating Launch Template specification will force a new instance.\n\nAny other instance parameters that you specify will override the same parameters in the launch template.\n\nThe `launch_template` block supports the following:\n\n* `id` - ID of the launch template. Conflicts with `name`.\n* `name` - Name of the launch template. Conflicts with `id`.\n* `version` - Template version. Can be a specific version number, `$Latest` or `$Default`. The default value is `$Default`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the instance.\n* `capacity_reservation_specification` - Capacity reservation specification of the instance.\n* `instance_state` - State of the instance. One of: `pending`, `running`, `shutting-down`, `terminated`, `stopping`, `stopped`. See [Instance Lifecycle](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-instance-lifecycle.html) for more information.\n* `outpost_arn` - ARN of the Outpost the instance is assigned to.\n* `password_data` - Base-64 encoded encrypted password data for the instance. Useful for getting the administrator password for instances running Microsoft Windows. This attribute is only exported if `get_password_data` is true. Note that this encrypted value will be stored in the state file, as with all exported attributes. See [GetPasswordData](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_GetPasswordData.html) for more information.\n* `primary_network_interface_id` - ID of the instance's primary network interface.\n* `private_dns` - Private DNS name assigned to the instance. Can only be used inside the Amazon EC2, and only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC.\n* `public_dns` - Public DNS name assigned to the instance. For EC2-VPC, this is only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC.\n* `public_ip` - Public IP address assigned to the instance, if applicable. **NOTE**: If you are using an [`aws_eip`](/docs/providers/aws/r/eip.html) with your instance, you should refer to the EIP's address directly and not use `public_ip` as this field will change after the EIP is attached.\n* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\nFor `ebs_block_device`, in addition to the arguments above, the following attribute is exported:\n\n* `volume_id` - ID of the volume. For example, the ID can be accessed like this, `aws_instance.web.ebs_block_device.2.volume_id`.\n\nFor `root_block_device`, in addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:\n\n* `volume_id` - ID of the volume. For example, the ID can be accessed like this, `aws_instance.web.root_block_device.0.volume_id`.\n* `device_name` - Device name, e.g., `/dev/sdh` or `xvdh`.\n\nFor `instance_market_options`, in addition to the arguments above, the following attributes are exported:\n\n* `instance_lifecycle` - Indicates whether this is a Spot Instance or a Scheduled Instance.\n* `spot_instance_request_id` - If the request is a Spot Instance request, the ID of the request.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `10m`)\n* `update` - (Default `10m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `20m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import instances using the `id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_instance.web\n  id = \"i-12345678\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import instances using the `id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_instance.web i-12345678\n```\n",
