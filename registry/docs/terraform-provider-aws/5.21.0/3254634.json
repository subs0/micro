The given filters must match exactly one Route Table whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\nThe following arguments are optional:\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block. Detailed below.\n* `gateway_id` - (Optional) ID of an Internet Gateway or Virtual Private Gateway which is connected to the Route Table (not exported if not passed as a parameter).\n* `route_table_id` - (Optional) ID of the specific Route Table to retrieve.\n* `subnet_id` - (Optional) ID of a Subnet which is connected to the Route Table (not exported if not passed as a parameter).\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Route Table.\n* `vpc_id` - (Optional) ID of the VPC that the desired Route Table belongs to.\n\n### filter\n\nComplex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` blocks.\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by [the underlying AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeRouteTables.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. A Route Table will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the route table.\n* `associations` - List of associations with attributes detailed below.\n* `owner_id` - ID of the AWS account that owns the route table.\n* `routes` - List of routes with attributes detailed below.\n\n### routes\n\nWhen relevant, routes are also exported with the following attributes:\n\nFor destinations:\n\n* `cidr_block` - CIDR block of the route.\n* `destination_prefix_list_id` - The ID of a [managed prefix list](ec2_managed_prefix_list.html) destination of the route.\n* `ipv6_cidr_block` - IPv6 CIDR block of the route.\n\nFor targets:\n\n* `carrier_gateway_id` - ID of the Carrier Gateway.\n* `core_network_arn` - ARN of the core network.\n* `egress_only_gateway_id` - ID of the Egress Only Internet Gateway.\n* `gateway_id` - Internet Gateway ID.\n* `instance_id` - EC2 instance ID.\n* `local_gateway_id` - Local Gateway ID.\n* `nat_gateway_id` - NAT Gateway ID.\n* `network_interface_id` - ID of the elastic network interface (eni) to use.\n* `transit_gateway_id` - EC2 Transit Gateway ID.\n* `vpc_endpoint_id` - VPC Endpoint ID.\n* `vpc_peering_connection_id` - VPC Peering ID.\n\n### associations\n\nAssociations are also exported with the following attributes:\n\n* `gateway_id` - Gateway ID. Only set when associated with an Internet Gateway or Virtual Private Gateway.\n* `main` - Whether the association is due to the main route table.\n* `route_table_association_id` - Association ID.\n* `route_table_id` - Route Table ID.\n* `subnet_id` - Subnet ID. Only set when associated with a subnet.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
