By default, fail open is disabled, which means the failure mode is closed. This approach favors security over availability. DNS Firewall blocks queries that it is unable to evaluate properly. If you enable this option, the failure mode is open. This approach favors availability over security. DNS Firewall allows queries to proceed if it is unable to properly evaluate them. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ID of the firewall configuration.\n* `owner_id` - The AWS account ID of the owner of the VPC that this firewall configuration applies to.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall configs using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config ID. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_route53_resolver_firewall_config.example\n  id = \"rdsc-be1866ecc1683e95\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall configs using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall config ID. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_firewall_config.example rdsc-be1866ecc1683e95\n```\n",
