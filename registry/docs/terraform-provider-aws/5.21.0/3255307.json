Across the entire AWS account, all of the users/roles/groups to which a single policy is attached must be declared by a single aws_iam_policy_attachment resource. This means that even any users/roles/groups that have the attached policy via any other mechanism (including other Terraform resources) will have that attached policy revoked by this resource. Consider `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment`, or `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment` instead. These resources do not enforce exclusive attachment of an IAM policy.\n\n~> **NOTE:** The usage of this resource conflicts with the `aws_iam_group_policy_attachment`, `aws_iam_role_policy_attachment`, and `aws_iam_user_policy_attachment` resources and will permanently show a difference if both are defined.\n\n~> **NOTE:** For a given role, this resource is incompatible with using the [`aws_iam_role` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/iam_role.html) `managed_policy_arns` argument. When using that argument and this resource, both will attempt to manage the role's managed policy attachments and Terraform will show a permanent difference.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_iam_user\" \"user\" {\n  name = \"test-user\"\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"assume_role\" {\n  statement {\n    effect = \"Allow\"\n\n    principals {\n      type        = \"Service\"\n      identifiers = [\"ec2.amazonaws.com\"]\n    }\n\n    actions = [\"sts:AssumeRole\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role\" \"role\" {\n  name               = \"test-role\"\n  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_group\" \"group\" {\n  name = \"test-group\"\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"policy\" {\n  statement {\n    effect    = \"Allow\"\n    actions   = [\"ec2:Describe*\"]\n    resources = [\"*\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_policy\" \"policy\" {\n  name        = \"test-policy\"\n  description = \"A test policy\"\n  policy      = data.aws_iam_policy_document.policy.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_policy_attachment\" \"test-attach\" {\n  name       = \"test-attachment\"\n  users      = [aws_iam_user.user.name]\n  roles      = [aws_iam_role.role.name]\n  groups     = [aws_iam_group.group.name]\n  policy_arn = aws_iam_policy.policy.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name`    (Required) - The name of the attachment. This cannot be an empty string.\n* `users`   (Optional) - The user(s) the policy should be applied to\n* `roles`   (Optional) - The role(s) the policy should be applied to\n* `groups`  (Optional) - The group(s) the policy should be applied to\n* `policy_arn`  (Required) - The ARN of the policy you want to apply\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The policy's ID.\n* `name` - The name of the attachment.\n",
