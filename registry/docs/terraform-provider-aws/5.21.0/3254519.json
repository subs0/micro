Providing no filter, would provide all license ARNs for the entire account.\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_licensemanager_received_licenses\" \"test\" {\n  filter {\n    name = \"IssuerName\"\n    values = [\n      \"AWS/Marketplace\"\n    ]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/license-manager/latest/APIReference/API_ListReceivedLicenses.html#API_ListReceivedLicenses_RequestSyntax).\n  For example, if filtering using `ProductSKU`, use:\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_licensemanager_received_licenses\" \"selected\" {\n  filter {\n    name   = \"ProductSKU\"\n    values = [\"\"] # insert values here\n  }\n}\n```\n\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arns` - List of all the license ARNs found.\n",
