Kinesis data stream name must begin with `\"AmazonWorkLink-\"`.\n* `device_ca_certificate` - (Optional) The certificate chain, including intermediate certificates and the root certificate authority certificate used to issue device certificates.\n* `identity_provider` - (Optional) Provide this to allow manage the identity provider configuration for the fleet. Fields documented below.\n* `display_name` - (Optional) The name of the fleet.\n* `network` - (Optional) Provide this to allow manage the company network configuration for the fleet. Fields documented below.\n* `optimize_for_end_user_location` - (Optional) The option to optimize for better performance by routing traffic through the closest AWS Region to users, which may be outside of your home Region. Defaults to `true`.\n\n**network** requires the following:\n\n~> **NOTE:** `network` cannot be removed without force recreating by `terraform taint`.\n\n* `vpc_id` - (Required) The VPC ID with connectivity to associated websites.\n* `subnet_ids` - (Required) A list of subnet IDs used for X-ENI connections from Amazon WorkLink rendering containers.\n* `security_group_ids` - (Required) A list of security group IDs associated with access to the provided subnets.\n\n**identity_provider** requires the following:\n\n~> **NOTE:** `identity_provider` cannot be removed without force recreating by `terraform taint`.\n\n* `type` - (Required) The type of identity provider.\n* `saml_metadata` - (Required) The SAML metadata document provided by the customerâ€™s identity provider.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ARN of the created WorkLink Fleet.\n* `arn` - The ARN of the created WorkLink Fleet.\n* `company_code` - The identifier used by users to sign in to the Amazon WorkLink app.\n* `created_time` - The time that the fleet was created.\n* `last_updated_time` - The time that the fleet was last updated.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_worklink_fleet.test\n  id = \"arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import WorkLink using the ARN. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_worklink_fleet.test arn:aws:worklink::123456789012:fleet/example\n```\n",
