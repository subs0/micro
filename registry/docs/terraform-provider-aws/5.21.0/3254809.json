Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n* `mesh_name` - (Required) Name of the service mesh in which to create the gateway route. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n* `virtual_gateway_name` - (Required) Name of the [virtual gateway](/docs/providers/aws/r/appmesh_virtual_gateway.html) to associate the gateway route with. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n* `mesh_owner` - (Optional) AWS account ID of the service mesh's owner. Defaults to the account ID the [AWS provider][1] is currently connected to.\n* `spec` - (Required) Gateway route specification to apply.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\nThe `spec` object supports the following:\n\n* `grpc_route` - (Optional) Specification of a gRPC gateway route.\n* `http_route` - (Optional) Specification of an HTTP gateway route.\n* `http2_route` - (Optional) Specification of an HTTP/2 gateway route.\n* `priority` - (Optional) Priority for the gateway route, between `0` and `1000`.\n\nThe `grpc_route`, `http_route` and `http2_route` objects supports the following:\n\n* `action` - (Required) Action to take if a match is determined.\n* `match` - (Required) Criteria for determining a request match.\n\nThe `grpc_route`, `http_route` and `http2_route`'s `action` object supports the following:\n\n* `target` - (Required) Target that traffic is routed to when a request matches the gateway route.\n\nThe `target` object supports the following:\n\n* `port` - (Optional) The port number that corresponds to the target for Virtual Service provider port. This is required when the provider (router or node) of the Virtual Service has multiple listeners.\n* `virtual_service` - (Required) Virtual service gateway route target.\n\nThe `virtual_service` object supports the following:\n\n* `virtual_service_name` - (Required) Name of the virtual service that traffic is routed to. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n\nThe `http_route` and `http2_route`'s `action` object additionally supports the following:\n\n* `rewrite` - (Optional) Gateway route action to rewrite.\n\nThe `rewrite` object supports the following:\n\n* `hostname` - (Optional) Host name to rewrite.\n* `path` - (Optional) Exact path to rewrite.\n* `prefix` - (Optional) Specified beginning characters to rewrite.\n\nThe `hostname` object supports the following:\n\n* `default_target_hostname` - (Required) Default target host name to write to. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.\n\nThe `path` object supports the following:\n\n* `exact` - (Required) Value used to replace matched path.\n\nThe `prefix` object supports the following:\n\n* `default_prefix` - (Optional) Default prefix used to replace the incoming route prefix when rewritten. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`.\n* `value` - (Optional) Value used to replace the incoming route prefix when rewritten.\n\nThe `grpc_route`'s `match` object supports the following:\n\n* `service_name` - (Required) Fully qualified domain name for the service to match from the request.\n* `port` - (Optional) The port number to match from the request.\n\nThe `http_route` and `http2_route`'s `match` object supports the following:\n\n* `header` - (Optional) Client request headers to match on.\n* `hostname` - (Optional) Host name to match on.\n* `path` - (Optional) Client request path to match on.\n* `port` - (Optional) The port number to match from the request.\n* `prefix` - (Optional) Path to match requests with. This parameter must always start with `/`, which by itself matches all requests to the virtual service name.\n* `query_parameter` - (Optional) Client request query parameters to match on.\n\nThe `header` object supports the following:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name for the HTTP header in the client request that will be matched on.\n* `invert` - (Optional) If `true`, the match is on the opposite of the `match` method and value. Default is `false`.\n* `match` - (Optional) Method and value to match the header value sent with a request. Specify one match method.\n\nThe `header`'s `match` object supports the following:\n\n* `exact` - (Optional) Header value sent by the client must match the specified value exactly.\n* `prefix` - (Optional) Header value sent by the client must begin with the specified characters.\n* `port`- (Optional) The port number to match from the request.\n* `range`- (Optional) Object that specifies the range of numbers that the header value sent by the client must be included in.\n* `regex` - (Optional) Header value sent by the client must include the specified characters.\n* `suffix` - (Optional) Header value sent by the client must end with the specified characters.\n\nThe `range` object supports the following:\n\n* `end` - (Required) End of the range.\n* `start` - (Requited) Start of the range.\n\nThe `hostname` object supports the following:\n\n* `exact` - (Optional) Exact host name to match on.\n* `suffix` - (Optional) Specified ending characters of the host name to match on.\n\nThe `path` object supports the following:\n\n* `exact` - (Optional) The exact path to match on.\n* `regex` - (Optional) The regex used to match the path.\n\nThe `query_parameter` object supports the following:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name for the query parameter that will be matched on.\n* `match` - (Optional) The query parameter to match on.\n\nThe `query_parameter`'s `match` object supports the following:\n\n* `exact` - (Optional) The exact query parameter to match on.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - ID of the gateway route.\n* `arn` - ARN of the gateway route.\n* `created_date` - Creation date of the gateway route.\n* `last_updated_date` - Last update date of the gateway route.\n* `resource_owner` - Resource owner's AWS account ID.\n* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh gateway routes using `mesh_name` and `virtual_gateway_name` together with the gateway route's `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_appmesh_gateway_route.example\n  id = \"mesh/gw1/example-gateway-route\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import App Mesh gateway routes using `mesh_name` and `virtual_gateway_name` together with the gateway route's `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_appmesh_gateway_route.example mesh/gw1/example-gateway-route\n```\n\n[1]: /docs/providers/aws/index.html\n",
