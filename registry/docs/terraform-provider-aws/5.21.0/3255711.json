For more information about these settings, see the [AWS S3 Block Public Access documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-control-block-public-access.html).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"example\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id\n\n  block_public_acls       = true\n  block_public_policy     = true\n  ignore_public_acls      = true\n  restrict_public_buckets = true\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `bucket` - (Required) S3 Bucket to which this Public Access Block configuration should be applied.\n* `block_public_acls` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should block public ACLs for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect existing policies or ACLs. When set to `true` causes the following behavior:\n    * PUT Bucket acl and PUT Object acl calls will fail if the specified ACL allows public access.\n    * PUT Object calls will fail if the request includes an object ACL.\n* `block_public_policy` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should block public bucket policies for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the existing bucket policy. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:\n    * Reject calls to PUT Bucket policy if the specified bucket policy allows public access.\n* `ignore_public_acls` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should ignore public ACLs for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the persistence of any existing ACLs and doesn't prevent new public ACLs from being set. When set to `true` causes Amazon S3 to:\n    * Ignore public ACLs on this bucket and any objects that it contains.\n* `restrict_public_buckets` - (Optional) Whether Amazon S3 should restrict public bucket policies for this bucket. Defaults to `false`. Enabling this setting does not affect the previously stored bucket policy, except that public and cross-account access within the public bucket policy, including non-public delegation to specific accounts, is blocked. When set to `true`:\n    * Only the bucket owner and AWS Services can access this buckets if it has a public policy.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - Name of the S3 bucket the configuration is attached to\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` using the bucket name. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.example\n  id = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import `aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block` using the bucket name. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_public_access_block.example my-bucket\n```\n",
