For AWS services the service name is usually in the form `com.amazonaws.<region>.<service>` (the SageMaker Notebook service is an exception to this rule, the service name is in the form `aws.sagemaker.<region>.notebook`).\n* `state` - (Optional) State of the specific VPC Endpoint to retrieve.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match\n  a pair on the specific VPC Endpoint to retrieve.\n* `vpc_id` - (Optional) ID of the VPC in which the specific VPC Endpoint is used.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeVpcEndpoints.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n  A VPC Endpoint will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nIn addition to all arguments above except `filter`, the following attributes are exported:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the VPC endpoint.\n* `cidr_blocks` - List of CIDR blocks for the exposed AWS service. Applicable for endpoints of type `Gateway`.\n* `dns_entry` - DNS entries for the VPC Endpoint. Applicable for endpoints of type `Interface`. [DNS entry blocks are documented below](#dns_entry-block).\n* `dns_options` - DNS options for the VPC Endpoint. [DNS options blocks are documented below](#dns_options-block).\n* `network_interface_ids` - One or more network interfaces for the VPC Endpoint. Applicable for endpoints of type `Interface`.\n* `owner_id` - ID of the AWS account that owns the VPC endpoint.\n* `policy` - Policy document associated with the VPC Endpoint. Applicable for endpoints of type `Gateway`.\n* `prefix_list_id` - Prefix list ID of the exposed AWS service. Applicable for endpoints of type `Gateway`.\n* `private_dns_enabled` - Whether or not the VPC is associated with a private hosted zone - `true` or `false`. Applicable for endpoints of type `Interface`.\n* `requester_managed` -  Whether or not the VPC Endpoint is being managed by its service - `true` or `false`.\n* `route_table_ids` - One or more route tables associated with the VPC Endpoint. Applicable for endpoints of type `Gateway`.\n* `security_group_ids` - One or more security groups associated with the network interfaces. Applicable for endpoints of type `Interface`.\n* `subnet_ids` - One or more subnets in which the VPC Endpoint is located. Applicable for endpoints of type `Interface`.\n* `vpc_endpoint_type` - VPC Endpoint type, `Gateway` or `Interface`.\n\n### `dns_entry` Block\n\nDNS blocks (for `dns_entry`) support the following attributes:\n\n* `dns_name` - DNS name.\n* `hosted_zone_id` - ID of the private hosted zone.\n\n### `dns_options` Block\n\nDNS options (for `dns_options`) support the following attributes:\n\n* `dns_record_ip_type` - The DNS records created for the endpoint.\n* `private_dns_only_for_inbound_resolver_endpoint` - Indicates whether to enable private DNS only for inbound endpoints.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
