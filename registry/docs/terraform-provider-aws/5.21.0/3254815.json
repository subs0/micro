Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n* `mesh_name` - (Required) Name of the service mesh in which to create the virtual service. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n* `mesh_owner` - (Optional) AWS account ID of the service mesh's owner. Defaults to the account ID the [AWS provider][1] is currently connected to.\n* `spec` - (Required) Virtual service specification to apply.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\nThe `spec` object supports the following:\n\n* `provider`- (Optional) App Mesh object that is acting as the provider for a virtual service. You can specify a single virtual node or virtual router.\n\nThe `provider` object supports the following:\n\n* `virtual_node` - (Optional) Virtual node associated with a virtual service.\n* `virtual_router` - (Optional) Virtual router associated with a virtual service.\n\nThe `virtual_node` object supports the following:\n\n* `virtual_node_name` - (Required) Name of the virtual node that is acting as a service provider. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n\nThe `virtual_router` object supports the following:\n\n* `virtual_router_name` - (Required) Name of the virtual router that is acting as a service provider. Must be between 1 and 255 characters in length.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - ID of the virtual service.\n* `arn` - ARN of the virtual service.\n* `created_date` - Creation date of the virtual service.\n* `last_updated_date` - Last update date of the virtual service.\n* `resource_owner` - Resource owner's AWS account ID.\n* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import App Mesh virtual services using `mesh_name` together with the virtual service's `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_appmesh_virtual_service.servicea\n  id = \"simpleapp/servicea.simpleapp.local\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import App Mesh virtual services using `mesh_name` together with the virtual service's `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_appmesh_virtual_service.servicea simpleapp/servicea.simpleapp.local\n```\n\n[1]: /docs/providers/aws/index.html\n",
