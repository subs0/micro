Valid values: `ALLOW`, `BLOCK`, `ALERT`.\n* `block_override_dns_type` - (Required if `block_response` is `OVERRIDE`) The DNS record's type. This determines the format of the record value that you provided in BlockOverrideDomain. Value values: `CNAME`.\n* `block_override_domain` - (Required if `block_response` is `OVERRIDE`) The custom DNS record to send back in response to the query.\n* `block_override_ttl` - (Required if `block_response` is `OVERRIDE`) The recommended amount of time, in seconds, for the DNS resolver or web browser to cache the provided override record. Minimum value of 0. Maximum value of 604800.\n* `block_response` - (Required if `action` is `BLOCK`) The way that you want DNS Firewall to block the request. Valid values: `NODATA`, `NXDOMAIN`, `OVERRIDE`.\n* `firewall_domain_list_id` - (Required) The ID of the domain list that you want to use in the rule.\n* `firewall_rule_group_id` - (Required) The unique identifier of the firewall rule group where you want to create the rule.\n* `priority` - (Required) The setting that determines the processing order of the rule in the rule group. DNS Firewall processes the rules in a rule group by order of priority, starting from the lowest setting.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ID of the rule.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group ID and domain list ID separated by ':'. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_route53_resolver_firewall_rule.example\n  id = \"rslvr-frg-0123456789abcdef:rslvr-fdl-0123456789abcdef\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rules using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group ID and domain list ID separated by ':'. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_firewall_rule.example rslvr-frg-0123456789abcdef:rslvr-fdl-0123456789abcdef\n```\n",
