If this attribute has a value, the job queue uses a fair share scheduling policy. If this attribute does not have a value, the job queue uses a first in, first out (FIFO) scheduling policy.\n* `status` - Current status of the job queue (for example, `CREATING` or `VALID`).\n* `status_reason` - Short, human-readable string to provide additional details about the current status\n    of the job queue.\n* `state` - Describes the ability of the queue to accept new jobs (for example, `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`).\n* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags\n* `priority` - Priority of the job queue. Job queues with a higher priority are evaluated first when\n    associated with the same compute environment.\n* `compute_environment_order` - The compute environments that are attached to the job queue and the order in\n    which job placement is preferred. Compute environments are selected for job placement in ascending order.\n    * `compute_environment_order.#.order` - The order of the compute environment.\n    * `compute_environment_order.#.compute_environment` - The ARN of the compute environment.\n",
