For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_directory_service_shared_directory.example\n  id = \"d-1234567890/d-9267633ece\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Directory Service Shared Directories using the owner directory ID/shared directory ID. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_directory_service_shared_directory.example d-1234567890/d-9267633ece\n```\n",
