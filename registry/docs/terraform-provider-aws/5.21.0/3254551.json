It is possible, however, to have multiple firewall policies available in a single account with identical `name` values but distinct `arn` values, e.g. firewall policies shared via a [Resource Access Manager (RAM) share][1]. In that case specifying `arn`, or `name` and `arn`, is recommended.\n\n~> **Note:** If there are multiple firewall policies in an account with the same `name`, and `arn` is not specified, the default behavior will return the firewall policy with `name` that was created in the account.\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nOne or more of the following arguments are required:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the firewall policy.\n* `name` - Descriptive name of the firewall policy.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `description` - Description of the firewall policy.\n* `firewall_policy` - The [policy][2] for the specified firewall policy.\n* `tags` - Key-value tags for the firewall policy.\n* `update_token` - Token used for optimistic locking.\n\n[1]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/ram_resource_share\n[2]: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/networkfirewall_firewall_policy\n",
