The given filters must match exactly one subnet whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\nThe following arguments are optional:\n\n* `availability_zone` - (Optional) Availability zone where the subnet must reside.\n* `availability_zone_id` - (Optional) ID of the Availability Zone for the subnet. This argument is not supported in all regions or partitions. If necessary, use `availability_zone` instead.\n* `cidr_block` - (Optional) CIDR block of the desired subnet.\n* `default_for_az` - (Optional) Whether the desired subnet must be the default subnet for its associated availability zone.\n* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block. Detailed below.\n* `id` - (Optional) ID of the specific subnet to retrieve.\n* `ipv6_cidr_block` - (Optional) IPv6 CIDR block of the desired subnet.\n* `state` - (Optional) State that the desired subnet must have.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired subnet.\n* `vpc_id` - (Optional) ID of the VPC that the desired subnet belongs to.\n\n### filter\n\nThis block allows for complex filters. You can use one or more `filter` blocks.\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by [the underlying AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSubnets.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. A subnet will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the subnet.\n* `assign_ipv6_address_on_creation` - Whether an IPv6 address is assigned on creation.\n* `available_ip_address_count` - Available IP addresses of the subnet.\n* `customer_owned_ipv4_pool` - Identifier of customer owned IPv4 address pool.\n* `enable_dns64` - Whether DNS queries made to the Amazon-provided DNS Resolver in this subnet return synthetic IPv6 addresses for IPv4-only destinations.\n* `enable_lni_at_device_index` - Indicates the device position for local network interfaces in this subnet. For example, 1 indicates local network interfaces in this subnet are the secondary network interface (eth1). A local network interface cannot be the primary network interface (eth0).\n* `enable_resource_name_dns_aaaa_record_on_launch` - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS AAAA records.\n* `enable_resource_name_dns_a_record_on_launch` - Indicates whether to respond to DNS queries for instance hostnames with DNS A records.\n* `ipv6_cidr_block_association_id` - Association ID of the IPv6 CIDR block.\n* `ipv6_native` - Whether this is an IPv6-only subnet.\n* `map_customer_owned_ip_on_launch` - Whether customer owned IP addresses are assigned on network interface creation.\n* `map_public_ip_on_launch` - Whether public IP addresses are assigned on instance launch.\n* `outpost_arn` - ARN of the Outpost.\n* `owner_id` - ID of the AWS account that owns the subnet.\n* `private_dns_hostname_type_on_launch` - The type of hostnames assigned to instances in the subnet at launch.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
