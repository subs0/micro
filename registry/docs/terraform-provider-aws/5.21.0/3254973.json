This resource is created by another service.\n---\n\n# Resource: aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client\n\nUse the `aws_cognito_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client.\n\n**This resource is advanced** and has special caveats to consider before use. Please read this document completely before using the resource.\n\nUse the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource to manage a Cognito User Pool Client that is automatically created by an AWS service. For instance, when [configuring an OpenSearch Domain to use Cognito authentication](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/opensearch-service/latest/developerguide/cognito-auth.html), the OpenSearch service creates the User Pool Client during setup and removes it when it is no longer required. As a result, the `aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client` resource does not create or delete this resource, but instead assumes management of it.\n\nUse the [`aws_cognito_user_pool_client`](cognito_user_pool_client.html) resource to manage Cognito User Pool Clients for normal use cases.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client\" \"example\" {\n  name_prefix  = \"AmazonOpenSearchService-example\"\n  user_pool_id = aws_cognito_user_pool.example.id\n\n  depends_on = [\n    aws_opensearch_domain.example,\n  ]\n}\n\nresource \"aws_cognito_user_pool\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"example\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_cognito_identity_pool\" \"example\" {\n  identity_pool_name = \"example\"\n\n  lifecycle {\n    ignore_changes = [cognito_identity_providers]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_opensearch_domain\" \"example\" {\n  domain_name = \"example\"\n\n  cognito_options {\n    enabled          = true\n    user_pool_id     = aws_cognito_user_pool.example.id\n    identity_pool_id = aws_cognito_identity_pool.example.id\n    role_arn         = aws_iam_role.example.arn\n  }\n\n  ebs_options {\n    ebs_enabled = true\n    volume_size = 10\n  }\n\n  depends_on = [\n    aws_cognito_user_pool_domain.example,\n    aws_iam_role_policy_attachment.example,\n  ]\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role\" \"example\" {\n  name               = \"example-role\"\n  path               = \"/service-role/\"\n  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.example.json\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"example\" {\n  statement {\n    sid     = \"\"\n    actions = [\"sts:AssumeRole\"]\n    effect  = \"Allow\"\n\n    principals {\n      type = \"Service\"\n      identifiers = [\n        \"es.${data.aws_partition.current.dns_suffix}\",\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role_policy_attachment\" \"example\" {\n  role       = aws_iam_role.example.name\n  policy_arn = \"arn:${data.aws_partition.current.partition}:iam::aws:policy/AmazonESCognitoAccess\"\n}\n\ndata \"aws_partition\" \"current\" {}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `user_pool_id` - (Required) User pool that the client belongs to.\n* `name_pattern` - (Required, one of `name_pattern` or `name_prefix`) Regular expression that matches the name of the desired User Pool Client.

It must match only one User Pool Client.\n\nThe following arguments are optional:\n\n* `access_token_validity` - (Optional) Time limit, between 5 minutes and 1 day, after which the access token is no longer valid and cannot be used. By default, the unit is hours. The unit can be overridden by a value in `token_validity_units.access_token`.\n* `allowed_oauth_flows_user_pool_client` - (Optional) Whether the client is allowed to use the OAuth protocol when interacting with Cognito user pools.\n* `allowed_oauth_flows` - (Optional) List of allowed OAuth flows, including code, implicit, and client_credentials.\n* `allowed_oauth_scopes` - (Optional) List of allowed OAuth scopes, including phone, email, openid, profile, and aws.cognito.signin.user.admin.\n* `analytics_configuration` - (Optional) Configuration block for Amazon Pinpoint analytics that collects metrics for this user pool. See [details below](#analytics_configuration).\n* `auth_session_validity` - (Optional) Duration, in minutes, of the session token created by Amazon Cognito for each API request in an authentication flow. The session token must be responded to by the native user of the user pool before it expires. Valid values for `auth_session_validity` are between `3` and `15`, with a default value of `3`.\n* `callback_urls` - (Optional) List of allowed callback URLs for the identity providers.\n* `default_redirect_uri` - (Optional) Default redirect URI and must be included in the list of callback URLs.\n* `enable_token_revocation` - (Optional) Enables or disables token revocation.\n* `enable_propagate_additional_user_context_data` - (Optional) Enables the propagation of additional user context data.\n* `explicit_auth_flows` - (Optional) List of authentication flows.

For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client\n  id = \"us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Cognito User Pool Clients using the `id` of the Cognito User Pool and the `id` of the Cognito User Pool Client. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cognito_managed_user_pool_client.client us-west-2_abc123/3ho4ek12345678909nh3fmhpko\n```\n",
