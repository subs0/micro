This allows instances to be\nrequested on the spot market.\n\nBy default Terraform creates Spot Instance Requests with a `persistent` type,\nwhich means that for the duration of their lifetime, AWS will launch an\ninstance with the configured details if and when the spot market will accept\nthe requested price.\n\nOn destruction, Terraform will make an attempt to terminate the associated Spot\nInstance if there is one present.\n\nSpot Instances requests with a `one-time` type will close the spot request\nwhen the instance is terminated either by the request being below the current spot\nprice availability or by a user.\n\n~> **NOTE:** Because their behavior depends on the live status of the spot\nmarket, Spot Instance Requests have a unique lifecycle that makes them behave\ndifferently than other Terraform resources. Most importantly: there is __no\nguarantee__ that a Spot Instance exists to fulfill the request at any given\npoint in time. See the [AWS Spot Instance\ndocumentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-spot-instances.html)\nfor more information.\n\n~> **NOTE [AWS strongly discourages](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-best-practices.html#which-spot-request-method-to-use) the use of the legacy APIs called by this resource.\nWe recommend using the [EC2 Instance](instance.html) resource with `instance_market_options` instead.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\n# Request a spot instance at $0.03\nresource \"aws_spot_instance_request\" \"cheap_worker\" {\n  ami           = \"ami-1234\"\n  spot_price    = \"0.03\"\n  instance_type = \"c4.xlarge\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"CheapWorker\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nSpot Instance Requests support all the same arguments as\n[`aws_instance`](instance.html), with the addition of:\n\n* `spot_price` - (Optional; Default: On-demand price) The maximum price to request on the spot market.\n* `wait_for_fulfillment` - (Optional; Default: false) If set, Terraform will\n  wait for the Spot Request to be fulfilled, and will throw an error if the\n  timeout of 10m is reached.\n* `spot_type` - (Optional; Default: `persistent`) If set to `one-time`, after\n  the instance is terminated, the spot request will be closed.\n* `launch_group` - (Optional) A launch group is a group of spot instances that launch together and terminate together.\n  If left empty instances are launched and terminated individually.\n* `block_duration_minutes` - (Optional) The required duration for the Spot instances, in minutes. This value must be a multiple of 60 (60, 120, 180, 240, 300, or 360).\n  The duration period starts as soon as your Spot instance receives its instance ID. At the end of the duration period, Amazon EC2 marks the Spot instance for termination and provides a Spot instance termination notice, which gives the instance a two-minute warning before it terminates.\n  Note that you can't specify an Availability Zone group or a launch group if you specify a duration.\n* `instance_interruption_behavior` - (Optional) Indicates Spot instance behavior when it is interrupted. Valid values are `terminate`, `stop`, or `hibernate`. Default value is `terminate`.\n* `valid_until` - (Optional) The end date and time of the request, in UTC [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) format(for example, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). At this point, no new Spot instance requests are placed or enabled to fulfill the request. The default end date is 7 days from the current date.\n* `valid_from` - (Optional) The start date and time of the request, in UTC [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) format(for example, YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ). The default is to start fulfilling the request immediately.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the Spot Instance Request. These tags are not automatically applied to the launched Instance. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The Spot Instance Request ID.\n\nThese attributes are exported, but they are expected to change over time and so\nshould only be used for informational purposes, not for resource dependencies:\n\n* `spot_bid_status` - The current [bid\n  status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-bid-status.html)\n  of the Spot Instance Request.\n* `spot_request_state` The current [request\n  state](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/spot-requests.html#creating-spot-request-status)\n  of the Spot Instance Request.\n* `spot_instance_id` - The Instance ID (if any) that is currently fulfilling\n  the Spot Instance request.\n* `public_dns` - The public DNS name assigned to the instance. For EC2-VPC, this\n  is only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames for your VPC\n* `public_ip` - The public IP address assigned to the instance, if applicable.\n* `private_dns` - The private DNS name assigned to the instance. Can only be\n  used inside the Amazon EC2, and only available if you've enabled DNS hostnames\n  for your VPC\n* `private_ip` - The private IP address assigned to the instance\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `10m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `20m`)\n",
