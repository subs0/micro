This parameter is required if you are using a load balancer with your service, but only if your task definition does not use the `awsvpc` network mode.

Required unless using the `EXTERNAL` deployment controller. If a revision is not specified, the latest `ACTIVE` revision is used.\n* `triggers` - (Optional) Map of arbitrary keys and values that, when changed, will trigger an in-place update (redeployment). Useful with `timestamp()`. See example above.\n* `wait_for_steady_state` - (Optional) If `true`, Terraform will wait for the service to reach a steady state (like [`aws ecs wait services-stable`](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ecs/wait/services-stable.html)) before continuing. Default `false`.\n\n### alarms\n\nThe `alarms` configuration block supports the following:\n\n* `alarm_names` - (Required) One or more CloudWatch alarm names.\n* `enable` - (Required) Determines whether to use the CloudWatch alarm option in the service deployment process.\n* `rollback` - (Required) Determines whether to configure Amazon ECS to roll back the service if a service deployment fails.

This allows configuration of [ECS service support for multiple target groups](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2019/07/amazon-ecs-services-now-support-multiple-load-balancer-target-groups/).\n\n### network_configuration\n\n`network_configuration` support the following:\n\n* `subnets` - (Required) Subnets associated with the task or service.\n* `security_groups` - (Optional) Security groups associated with the task or service.

Default `false`.\n\nFor more information, see [Task Networking](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/developerguide/task-networking.html)\n\n### ordered_placement_strategy\n\n`ordered_placement_strategy` supports the following:\n\n* `type` - (Required) Type of placement strategy. Must be one of: `binpack`, `random`, or `spread`\n* `field` - (Optional) For the `spread` placement strategy, valid values are `instanceId` (or `host`,\n which has the same effect), or any platform or custom attribute that is applied to a container instance.\n For the `binpack` type, valid values are `memory` and `cpu`. For the `random` type, this attribute is not\n needed. For more information, see [Placement Strategy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECS/latest/APIReference/API_PlacementStrategy.html).\n\n-> **Note:** for `spread`, `host` and `instanceId` will be normalized, by AWS, to be `instanceId`. This means the statefile will show `instanceId` but your config will differ if you use `host`.\n\n### placement_constraints\n\n`placement_constraints` support the following:\n\n* `type` - (Required) Type of constraint. The only valid values at this time are `memberOf` and `distinctInstance`.\n* `expression` -  (Optional) Cluster Query Language expression to apply to the constraint. Does not need to be specified for the `distinctInstance` type.
