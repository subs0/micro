Removing this resource from your configuration will remove it from your statefile and Terraform management.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n### Basic Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_lightsail_container_service_deployment_version\" \"example\" {\n  container {\n    container_name = \"hello-world\"\n    image          = \"amazon/amazon-lightsail:hello-world\"\n\n    command = []\n\n    environment = {\n      MY_ENVIRONMENT_VARIABLE = \"my_value\"\n    }\n\n    ports = {\n      80 = \"HTTP\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  public_endpoint {\n    container_name = \"hello-world\"\n    container_port = 80\n\n    health_check {\n      healthy_threshold   = 2\n      unhealthy_threshold = 2\n      timeout_seconds     = 2\n      interval_seconds    = 5\n      path                = \"/\"\n      success_codes       = \"200-499\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  service_name = aws_lightsail_container_service.example.name\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `service_name` - (Required) The name for the container service.\n* `container` - (Required) A set of configuration blocks that describe the settings of the containers that will be launched on the container service. Maximum of 53. [Detailed below](#container).\n* `public_endpoint` - (Optional) A configuration block that describes the settings of the public endpoint for the container service. [Detailed below](#public_endpoint).\n\n### `container`\n\nThe `container` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `container_name` - (Required) The name for the container.\n* `image` - (Required) The name of the image used for the container. Container images sourced from your Lightsail container service, that are registered and stored on your service, start with a colon (`:`). For example, `:container-service-1.mystaticwebsite.1`. Container images sourced from a public registry like Docker Hub don't start with a colon. For example, `nginx:latest` or `nginx`.\n* `command` - (Optional) The launch command for the container. A list of string.\n* `environment` - (Optional) A key-value map of the environment variables of the container.\n* `ports` - (Optional) A key-value map of the open firewall ports of the container. Valid values: `HTTP`, `HTTPS`, `TCP`, `UDP`.\n\n### `public_endpoint`\n\nThe `public_endpoint` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `container_name` - (Required) The name of the container for the endpoint.\n* `container_port` - (Required) The port of the container to which traffic is forwarded to.\n* `health_check` - (Required) A configuration block that describes the health check configuration of the container. [Detailed below](#health_check).\n\n### `health_check`\n\nThe `health_check` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `healthy_threshold` - (Optional) The number of consecutive health checks successes required before moving the container to the Healthy state. Defaults to 2.\n* `unhealthy_threshold` - (Optional) The number of consecutive health checks failures required before moving the container to the Unhealthy state. Defaults to 2.\n* `timeout_seconds` - (Optional) The amount of time, in seconds, during which no response means a failed health check. You can specify between 2 and 60 seconds. Defaults to 2.\n* `interval_seconds` - (Optional) The approximate interval, in seconds, between health checks of an individual container. You can specify between 5 and 300 seconds. Defaults to 5.\n* `path` - (Optional) The path on the container on which to perform the health check. Defaults to \"/\".\n* `success_codes` - (Optional) The HTTP codes to use when checking for a successful response from a container. You can specify values between 200 and 499. Defaults to \"200-499\".\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The `service_name` and `version` separation by a slash (`/`).\n* `created_at` - The timestamp when the deployment was created.\n* `state` - The current state of the container service.\n* `version` - The version number of the deployment.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `30m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Lightsail Container Service Deployment Version using the `service_name` and `version` separated by a slash (`/`). For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_lightsail_container_service_deployment_version.example\n  id = \"container-service-1/1\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Lightsail Container Service Deployment Version using the `service_name` and `version` separated by a slash (`/`). For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_lightsail_container_service_deployment_version.example container-service-1/1\n```\n",
