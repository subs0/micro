In addition, the following attributes\nare exported:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the Kinesis Stream (same as id).\n* `name` - Name of the Kinesis Stream.\n* `creation_timestamp` - Approximate UNIX timestamp that the stream was created.\n* `status` - Current status of the stream. The stream status is one of CREATING, DELETING, ACTIVE, or UPDATING.\n* `retention_period` - Length of time (in hours) data records are accessible after they are added to the stream.\n* `open_shards` - List of shard ids in the OPEN state. See [Shard State][2] for more.\n* `closed_shards` - List of shard ids in the CLOSED state. See [Shard State][2] for more.\n* `shard_level_metrics` - List of shard-level CloudWatch metrics which are enabled for the stream. See [Monitoring with CloudWatch][3] for more.\n* `stream_mode_details` - [Capacity mode][4] of the data stream. Detailed below.\n* `tags` - Map of tags to assigned to the stream.\n\n### stream_mode_details Configuration Block\n\n* `stream_mode` - Capacity mode of the stream. Either `ON_DEMAND` or `PROVISIONED`.\n\n[1]: https://aws.amazon.com/documentation/kinesis/\n[2]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/kinesis-using-sdk-java-after-resharding.html#kinesis-using-sdk-java-resharding-data-routing\n[3]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/monitoring-with-cloudwatch.html\n[4]: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/streams/latest/dev/how-do-i-size-a-stream.html\n",
