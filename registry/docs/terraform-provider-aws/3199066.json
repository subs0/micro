Managing SSH keys can be accomplished with the [`aws_transfer_ssh_key` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/transfer_ssh_key.html).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_transfer_server\" \"foo\" {\n  identity_provider_type = \"SERVICE_MANAGED\"\n\n  tags = {\n    NAME = \"tf-acc-test-transfer-server\"\n  }\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"assume_role\" {\n  statement {\n    effect = \"Allow\"\n\n    principals {\n      type        = \"Service\"\n      identifiers = [\"transfer.amazonaws.com\"]\n    }\n\n    actions = [\"sts:AssumeRole\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role\" \"foo\" {\n  name               = \"tf-test-transfer-user-iam-role\"\n  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json\n}\n\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"foo\" {\n  statement {\n    sid       = \"AllowFullAccesstoS3\"\n    effect    = \"Allow\"\n    actions   = [\"s3:*\"]\n    resources = [\"*\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role_policy\" \"foo\" {\n  name   = \"tf-test-transfer-user-iam-policy\"\n  role   = aws_iam_role.foo.id\n  policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.foo.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_transfer_user\" \"foo\" {\n  server_id = aws_transfer_server.foo.id\n  user_name = \"tftestuser\"\n  role      = aws_iam_role.foo.arn\n\n  home_directory_type = \"LOGICAL\"\n  home_directory_mappings {\n    entry  = \"/test.pdf\"\n    target = \"/bucket3/test-path/tftestuser.pdf\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `server_id` - (Required) The Server ID of the Transfer Server (e.g., `s-12345678`)\n* `user_name` - (Required) The name used for log in to your SFTP server.\n* `home_directory` - (Optional) The landing directory (folder) for a user when they log in to the server using their SFTP client.  It should begin with a `/`.  The first item in the path is the name of the home bucket (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeBucket}` in the policy) and the rest is the home directory (accessible as `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}` in the policy). For example, `/example-bucket-1234/username` would set the home bucket to `example-bucket-1234` and the home directory to `username`.\n* `home_directory_mappings` - (Optional) Logical directory mappings that specify what S3 paths and keys should be visible to your user and how you want to make them visible. See [Home Directory Mappings](#home-directory-mappings) below.\n* `home_directory_type` - (Optional) The type of landing directory (folder) you mapped for your users' home directory. Valid values are `PATH` and `LOGICAL`.\n* `policy` - (Optional) An IAM JSON policy document that scopes down user access to portions of their Amazon S3 bucket. IAM variables you can use inside this policy include `${Transfer:UserName}`, `${Transfer:HomeDirectory}`, and `${Transfer:HomeBucket}`. Since the IAM variable syntax matches Terraform's interpolation syntax, they must be escaped inside Terraform configuration strings (`$${Transfer:UserName}`).  These are evaluated on-the-fly when navigating the bucket.\n* `posix_profile` - (Optional) Specifies the full POSIX identity, including user ID (Uid), group ID (Gid), and any secondary groups IDs (SecondaryGids), that controls your users' access to your Amazon EFS file systems. See [Posix Profile](#posix-profile) below.\n* `role` - (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of an IAM role that allows the service to control your userâ€™s access to your Amazon S3 bucket.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n### Home Directory Mappings\n\n* `entry` - (Required) Represents an entry and a target.\n* `target` - (Required) Represents the map target.\n\nThe `Restricted` option is achieved using the following mapping:\n\n```\nhome_directory_mappings {\n\tentry  = \"/\"\n\ttarget = \"/${aws_s3_bucket.foo.id}/$${Transfer:UserName}\"\n}\n```\n\n### Posix Profile\n\n* `gid` - (Required) The POSIX group ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\n* `uid` - (Required) The POSIX user ID used for all EFS operations by this user.\n* `secondary_gids` - (Optional) The secondary POSIX group IDs used for all EFS operations by this user.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of Transfer User\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `delete` - (Default `10m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Transfer Users using the `server_id` and `user_name` separated by `/`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_transfer_user.bar\n  id = \"s-12345678/test-username\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Transfer Users using the `server_id` and `user_name` separated by `/`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_transfer_user.bar s-12345678/test-username\n```\n",
