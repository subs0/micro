These objects can be connected to VPN gateways via VPN connections, and allow you to establish tunnels between your network and the VPC.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_customer_gateway\" \"main\" {\n  bgp_asn    = 65000\n  ip_address = \"172.83.124.10\"\n  type       = \"ipsec.1\"\n\n  tags = {\n    Name = \"main-customer-gateway\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `bgp_asn` - (Required) The gateway's Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) Autonomous System Number (ASN).\n* `certificate_arn` - (Optional) The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) for the customer gateway certificate.\n* `device_name` - (Optional) A name for the customer gateway device.\n* `ip_address` - (Optional) The IPv4 address for the customer gateway device's outside interface.\n* `type` - (Required) The type of customer gateway. The only type AWS\n  supports at this time is \"ipsec.1\".\n* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the gateway. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The amazon-assigned ID of the gateway.\n* `arn` - The ARN of the customer gateway.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Customer Gateways using the `id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_customer_gateway.main\n  id = \"cgw-b4dc3961\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Customer Gateways using the `id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_customer_gateway.main cgw-b4dc3961\n```\n",
