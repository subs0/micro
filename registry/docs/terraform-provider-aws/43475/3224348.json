The `fairshare_policy` block is documented below.\n* `name` - Name of the scheduling policy.\n* `tags` - Key-value map of resource tags\n\nA `fairshare_policy` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `compute_reservation` - Value used to reserve some of the available maximum vCPU for fair share identifiers that have not yet been used. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).\n* `share_delay_seconds` - Time period to use to calculate a fair share percentage for each fair share identifier in use, in seconds. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html).\n* `share_distribution` - One or more share distribution blocks which define the weights for the fair share identifiers for the fair share policy. For more information, see [FairsharePolicy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_FairsharePolicy.html). The `share_distribution` block is documented below.\n\nA `share_distribution` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `share_identifier` - Fair share identifier or fair share identifier prefix. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).\n* `weight_factor` - Weight factor for the fair share identifier. For more information, see [ShareAttributes](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/batch/latest/APIReference/API_ShareAttributes.html).\n",
