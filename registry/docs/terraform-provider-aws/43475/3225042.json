Moreover, creating triggers with Terraform will delete all other triggers in the repository (also manually-created triggers).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_codecommit_repository\" \"test\" {\n  repository_name = \"test\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_codecommit_trigger\" \"test\" {\n  repository_name = aws_codecommit_repository.test.repository_name\n\n  trigger {\n    name            = \"all\"\n    events          = [\"all\"]\n    destination_arn = aws_sns_topic.test.arn\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `repository_name` - (Required) The name for the repository. This needs to be less than 100 characters.\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the trigger.\n* `destination_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the resource that is the target for a trigger. For example, the ARN of a topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS).\n* `custom_data` - (Optional) Any custom data associated with the trigger that will be included in the information sent to the target of the trigger.\n* `branches` - (Optional) The branches that will be included in the trigger configuration. If no branches are specified, the trigger will apply to all branches.\n* `events` - (Required) The repository events that will cause the trigger to run actions in another service, such as sending a notification through Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS). If no events are specified, the trigger will run for all repository events. Event types include: `all`, `updateReference`, `createReference`, `deleteReference`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `configuration_id` - System-generated unique identifier.\n",
