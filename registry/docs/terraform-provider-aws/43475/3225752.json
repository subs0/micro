If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN (Amazon Resource Name) of the rule group.\n* `id` - The ID of the rule group.\n* `owner_id` - The AWS account ID for the account that created the rule group. When a rule group is shared with your account, this is the account that has shared the rule group with you.\n* `share_status` - Whether the rule group is shared with other AWS accounts, or was shared with the current account by another AWS account. Sharing is configured through AWS Resource Access Manager (AWS RAM). Valid values: `NOT_SHARED`, `SHARED_BY_ME`, `SHARED_WITH_ME`\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group ID. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_route53_resolver_firewall_rule_group.example\n  id = \"rslvr-frg-0123456789abcdef\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import  Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule groups using the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall rule group ID. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_firewall_rule_group.example rslvr-frg-0123456789abcdef\n```\n",
