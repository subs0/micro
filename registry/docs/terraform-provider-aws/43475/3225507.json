A bucket bundle specifies the monthly cost, storage space, and data transfer quota for a bucket. Use the [get-bucket-bundles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/lightsail/get-bucket-bundles.html) cli command to get a list of bundle IDs that you can specify.\n* `force_delete` - (Optional) - Force Delete non-empty buckets using `terraform destroy`. AWS by default will not delete an s3 bucket which is not empty, to prevent losing bucket data and affecting other resources in lightsail. If `force_delete` is set to `true` the bucket will be deleted even when not empty.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. To create a key-only tag, use an empty string as the value. If configured with a provider `default_tags` configuration block present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The name used for this bucket (matches `name`).\n* `arn` - The ARN of the lightsail bucket.\n* `availability_zone` - The resource Availability Zone. Follows the format us-east-2a (case-sensitive).\n* `created_at` - The timestamp when the bucket was created.\n* `region` - The Amazon Web Services Region name.\n* `support_code` - The support code for the resource. Include this code in your email to support when you have questions about a resource in Lightsail. This code enables our support team to look up your Lightsail information more easily.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider `default_tags` configuration block.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_lightsail_bucket` using the `name` attribute. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_lightsail_bucket.test\n  id = \"example-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import `aws_lightsail_bucket` using the `name` attribute. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_lightsail_bucket.test example-bucket\n```\n",
