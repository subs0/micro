Do not use the same security group ID in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Security\nGroup Association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nBasic usage:\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_vpc_endpoint_security_group_association\" \"sg_ec2\" {\n  vpc_endpoint_id   = aws_vpc_endpoint.ec2.id\n  security_group_id = aws_security_group.sg.id\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `security_group_id` - (Required) The ID of the security group to be associated with the VPC endpoint.\n* `vpc_endpoint_id` - (Required) The ID of the VPC endpoint with which the security group will be associated.\n* `replace_default_association` - (Optional) Whether this association should replace the association with the VPC's default security group that is created when no security groups are specified during VPC endpoint creation. At most 1 association per-VPC endpoint should be configured with `replace_default_association = true`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ID of the association.\n",
