The given filters must match exactly one\nsecurity group whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.\n\n* `id` - (Optional) Id of the specific security group to retrieve.\n\n* `name` - (Optional) Name that the desired security group must have.\n\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match\n  a pair on the desired security group.\n\n* `vpc_id` - (Optional) Id of the VPC that the desired security group belongs to.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeSecurityGroups.html).\n\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n  A Security Group will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nAll of the argument attributes except `filter` blocks are also exported as\nresult attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating\nany fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for\nthe selected Security Group.\n\nThe following fields are also exported:\n\n* `description` - Description of the security group.\n* `arn` - Computed ARN of the security group.\n\n~> **Note:** The [default security group for a VPC](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_SecurityGroups.html#DefaultSecurityGroup) has the name `default`.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
