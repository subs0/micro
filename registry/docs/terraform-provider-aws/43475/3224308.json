Valid values: an AWS account ID, `self` (the current account), or an AWS owner alias (e.g., `amazon`, `aws-marketplace`, `microsoft`).\n\n* `most_recent` - (Optional) If more than one result is returned, use the most\nrecent AMI.\n\n* `executable_users` - (Optional) Limit search to users with *explicit* launch permission on\n the image. Valid items are the numeric account ID or `self`.\n\n* `include_deprecated` - (Optional) If true, all deprecated AMIs are included in the response. If false, no deprecated AMIs are included in the response. If no value is specified, the default value is false.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to filter off of. There are\nseveral valid keys, for a full reference, check out\n[describe-images in the AWS CLI reference][1].\n\n* `name_regex` - (Optional) Regex string to apply to the AMI list returned\nby AWS. This allows more advanced filtering not supported from the AWS API. This\nfiltering is done locally on what AWS returns, and could have a performance\nimpact if the result is large. Combine this with other\noptions to narrow down the list AWS returns.\n\n~> **NOTE:** If more or less than a single match is returned by the search,\nTerraform will fail. Ensure that your search is specific enough to return\na single AMI ID only, or use `most_recent` to choose the most recent one. If\nyou want to match multiple AMIs, use the `aws_ami_ids` data source instead.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\n`id` is set to the ID of the found AMI. In addition, the following attributes\nare exported:\n\n~> **NOTE:** Some values are not always set and may not be available for\ninterpolation.\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the AMI.\n* `architecture` - OS architecture of the AMI (ie: `i386` or `x86_64`).\n* `boot_mode` - Boot mode of the image.\n* `block_device_mappings` - Set of objects with block device mappings of the AMI.\n    * `device_name` - Physical name of the device.\n    * `ebs` - Map containing EBS information, if the device is EBS based. Unlike most object attributes, these are accessed directly (e.g., `ebs.volume_size` or `ebs[\"volume_size\"]`) rather than accessed through the first element of a list (e.g., `ebs[0].volume_size`).\n        * `delete_on_termination` - `true` if the EBS volume will be deleted on termination.\n        * `encrypted` - `true` if the EBS volume is encrypted.\n        * `iops` - `0` if the EBS volume is not a provisioned IOPS image, otherwise the supported IOPS count.\n        * `snapshot_id` - The ID of the snapshot.\n        * `volume_size` - The size of the volume, in GiB.\n        * `throughput` - The throughput that the EBS volume supports, in MiB/s.\n        * `volume_type` - The volume type.\n    * `no_device` - Suppresses the specified device included in the block device mapping of the AMI.\n    * `virtual_name` - Virtual device name (for instance stores).\n* `creation_date` - Date and time the image was created.\n* `deprecation_time` - Date and time when the image will be deprecated.\n* `description` - Description of the AMI that was provided during image\n  creation.\n* `hypervisor` - Hypervisor type of the image.\n* `image_id` - ID of the AMI. Should be the same as the resource `id`.\n* `image_location` - Location of the AMI.\n* `image_owner_alias` - AWS account alias (for example, `amazon`, `self`) or\n  the AWS account ID of the AMI owner.\n* `image_type` - Type of image.\n* `imds_support` - Instance Metadata Service (IMDS) support mode for the image. Set to `v2.0` if instances ran from this image enforce IMDSv2.\n* `kernel_id` - Kernel associated with the image, if any. Only applicable\n  for machine images.\n* `name` - Name of the AMI that was provided during image creation.\n* `owner_id` - AWS account ID of the image owner.\n* `platform` - Value is Windows for `Windows` AMIs; otherwise blank.\n* `product_codes` - Any product codes associated with the AMI.\n    * `product_codes.#.product_code_id` - The product code.\n    * `product_codes.#.product_code_type` - The type of product code.\n* `public` - `true` if the image has public launch permissions.\n* `ramdisk_id` - RAM disk associated with the image, if any. Only applicable\n  for machine images.\n* `root_device_name` - Device name of the root device.\n* `root_device_type` - Type of root device (ie: `ebs` or `instance-store`).\n* `root_snapshot_id` - Snapshot id associated with the root device, if any\n  (only applies to `ebs` root devices).\n* `sriov_net_support` - Whether enhanced networking is enabled.\n* `state` - Current state of the AMI. If the state is `available`, the image\n  is successfully registered and can be used to launch an instance.\n* `state_reason` - Describes a state change. Fields are `UNSET` if not available.\n    * `state_reason.code` - The reason code for the state change.\n    * `state_reason.message` - The message for the state change.\n* `tags` - Any tags assigned to the image.\n    * `tags.#.key` - Key name of the tag.\n    * `tags.#.value` - Value of the tag.\n* `tpm_support` - If the image is configured for NitroTPM support, the value is `v2.0`.\n* `virtualization_type` - Type of virtualization of the AMI (ie: `hvm` or\n  `paravirtual`).\n* `usage_operation` - Operation of the Amazon EC2 instance and the billing code that is associated with the AMI.\n* `platform_details` - Platform details associated with the billing code of the AMI.\n* `ena_support` - Whether enhanced networking with ENA is enabled.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n\n[1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-images.html\n",
