Defaults to the CIDR block of the VPC associated with the Virtual Gateway. To enable drift detection, must be configured.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association resource.\n* `associated_gateway_type` - The type of the associated gateway, `transitGateway` or `virtualPrivateGateway`.\n* `dx_gateway_association_id` - The ID of the Direct Connect gateway association.\n* `dx_gateway_owner_account_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the Direct Connect gateway.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `create` - (Default `30m`)\n- `update` - (Default `30m`)\n- `delete` - (Default `30m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect gateway associations using `dx_gateway_id` together with `associated_gateway_id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_dx_gateway_association.example\n  id = \"345508c3-7215-4aef-9832-07c125d5bd0f/vgw-98765432\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Direct Connect gateway associations using `dx_gateway_id` together with `associated_gateway_id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association.example 345508c3-7215-4aef-9832-07c125d5bd0f/vgw-98765432\n```\n",
