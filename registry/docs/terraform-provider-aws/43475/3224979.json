For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloud9_environment_membership.test\n  id = \"environment-id#user-arn\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Cloud9 environment membership using the `environment-id#user-arn`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloud9_environment_membership.test environment-id#user-arn\n```\n",
