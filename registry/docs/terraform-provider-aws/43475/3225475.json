In other words, the S3 path is added to the data lake.\n\nChoose a role that has read/write access to the chosen Amazon S3 path or use the service-linked role. When you register the S3 path, the service-linked role and a new inline policy are created on your behalf. Lake Formation adds the first path to the inline policy and attaches it to the service-linked role. When you register subsequent paths, Lake Formation adds the path to the existing policy.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"an-example-bucket\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_lakeformation_resource\" \"example\" {\n  arn = data.aws_s3_bucket.example.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\n* `arn` – (Required) Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the resource, an S3 path.\n* `role_arn` – (Optional) Role that has read/write access to the resource. If not provided, the Lake Formation service-linked role must exist and is used.\n\n~> **NOTE:** AWS does not support registering an S3 location with an IAM role and subsequently updating the S3 location registration to a service-linked role.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `last_modified` - (Optional) The date and time the resource was last modified in [RFC 3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8).\n",
