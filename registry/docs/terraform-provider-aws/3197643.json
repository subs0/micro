The permitted values are: `pending, running, shutting-down, stopped, stopping, terminated`. The default value is `running`.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are\nseveral valid keys, for a full reference, check out\n[describe-instances in the AWS CLI reference][1].\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - AWS Region.\n* `ids` - IDs of instances found through the filter\n* `private_ips` - Private IP addresses of instances found through the filter\n* `public_ips` - Public IP addresses of instances found through the filter\n* `ipv6_addresses` - IPv6 addresses of instances found through the filter\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n\n[1]: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/reference/ec2/describe-instances.html\n",
