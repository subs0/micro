This ASG is _not_ managed by terraform and will conflict with existing configuration and state. You may want to use a different approach to managing deployments that involve multiple ASG, such as `DISCOVER_EXISTING` with separate blue and green ASG.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_iam_policy_document\" \"assume_role\" {\n  statement {\n    effect = \"Allow\"\n\n    principals {\n      type        = \"Service\"\n      identifiers = [\"codedeploy.amazonaws.com\"]\n    }\n\n    actions = [\"sts:AssumeRole\"]\n  }\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role\" \"example\" {\n  name               = \"example-role\"\n  assume_role_policy = data.aws_iam_policy_document.assume_role.json\n}\n\nresource \"aws_iam_role_policy_attachment\" \"AWSCodeDeployRole\" {\n  policy_arn = \"arn:aws:iam::aws:policy/service-role/AWSCodeDeployRole\"\n  role       = aws_iam_role.example.name\n}\n\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_app\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"example-app\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_sns_topic\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"example-topic\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_deployment_group\" \"example\" {\n  app_name              = aws_codedeploy_app.example.name\n  deployment_group_name = \"example-group\"\n  service_role_arn      = aws_iam_role.example.arn\n\n  ec2_tag_set {\n    ec2_tag_filter {\n      key   = \"filterkey1\"\n      type  = \"KEY_AND_VALUE\"\n      value = \"filtervalue\"\n    }\n\n    ec2_tag_filter {\n      key   = \"filterkey2\"\n      type  = \"KEY_AND_VALUE\"\n      value = \"filtervalue\"\n    }\n  }\n\n  trigger_configuration {\n    trigger_events     = [\"DeploymentFailure\"]\n    trigger_name       = \"example-trigger\"\n    trigger_target_arn = aws_sns_topic.example.arn\n  }\n\n  auto_rollback_configuration {\n    enabled = true\n    events  = [\"DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE\"]\n  }\n\n  alarm_configuration {\n    alarms  = [\"my-alarm-name\"]\n    enabled = true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Blue Green Deployments with ECS\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_app\" \"example\" {\n  compute_platform = \"ECS\"\n  name             = \"example\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_deployment_group\" \"example\" {\n  app_name               = aws_codedeploy_app.example.name\n  deployment_config_name = \"CodeDeployDefault.ECSAllAtOnce\"\n  deployment_group_name  = \"example\"\n  service_role_arn       = aws_iam_role.example.arn\n\n  auto_rollback_configuration {\n    enabled = true\n    events  = [\"DEPLOYMENT_FAILURE\"]\n  }\n\n  blue_green_deployment_config {\n    deployment_ready_option {\n      action_on_timeout = \"CONTINUE_DEPLOYMENT\"\n    }\n\n    terminate_blue_instances_on_deployment_success {\n      action                           = \"TERMINATE\"\n      termination_wait_time_in_minutes = 5\n    }\n  }\n\n  deployment_style {\n    deployment_option = \"WITH_TRAFFIC_CONTROL\"\n    deployment_type   = \"BLUE_GREEN\"\n  }\n\n  ecs_service {\n    cluster_name = aws_ecs_cluster.example.name\n    service_name = aws_ecs_service.example.name\n  }\n\n  load_balancer_info {\n    target_group_pair_info {\n      prod_traffic_route {\n        listener_arns = [aws_lb_listener.example.arn]\n      }\n\n      target_group {\n        name = aws_lb_target_group.blue.name\n      }\n\n      target_group {\n        name = aws_lb_target_group.green.name\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Blue Green Deployments with Servers and Classic ELB\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_app\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"example-app\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_codedeploy_deployment_group\" \"example\" {\n  app_name              = aws_codedeploy_app.example.name\n  deployment_group_name = \"example-group\"\n  service_role_arn      = aws_iam_role.example.arn\n\n  deployment_style {\n    deployment_option = \"WITH_TRAFFIC_CONTROL\"\n    deployment_type   = \"BLUE_GREEN\"\n  }\n\n  load_balancer_info {\n    elb_info {\n      name = aws_elb.example.name\n    }\n  }\n\n  blue_green_deployment_config {\n    deployment_ready_option {\n      action_on_timeout    = \"STOP_DEPLOYMENT\"\n      wait_time_in_minutes = 60\n    }\n\n    green_fleet_provisioning_option {\n      action = \"DISCOVER_EXISTING\"\n    }\n\n    terminate_blue_instances_on_deployment_success {\n      action = \"KEEP_ALIVE\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `app_name` -
