If omitted, Terraform will assign a random, unique name. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 63 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules [may be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).\n* `bucket_prefix` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Creates a unique bucket name beginning with the specified prefix. Conflicts with `bucket`. Must be lowercase and less than or equal to 37 characters in length. A full list of bucket naming rules [may be found here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/bucketnamingrules.html).\n* `force_destroy` - (Optional, Default:`false`) Boolean that indicates all objects (including any [locked objects](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/object-lock-overview.html)) should be deleted from the bucket *when the bucket is destroyed* so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are *not* recoverable. This only deletes objects when the bucket is destroyed, *not* when setting this parameter to `true`. Once this parameter is set to `true`, there must be a successful `terraform apply` run before a destroy is required to update this value in the resource state. Without a successful `terraform apply` after this parameter is set, this flag will have no effect. If setting this field in the same operation that would require replacing the bucket or destroying the bucket, this flag will not work. Additionally when importing a bucket, a successful `terraform apply` is required to set this value in state before it will take effect on a destroy operation.\n* `object_lock_enabled` - (Optional, Forces new resource) Indicates whether this bucket has an Object Lock configuration enabled. Valid values are `true` or `false`. This argument is not supported in all regions or partitions.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags to assign to the bucket.

To manage changes of CORS rules to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resource instead. If you use `cors_rule` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of CORS rules for the S3 bucket, treating additional CORS rules as drift. For this reason, `cors_rule` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_cors_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `cors_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `allowed_headers` - (Optional) List of headers allowed.\n* `allowed_methods` - (Required) One or more HTTP methods that you allow the origin to execute. Can be `GET`, `PUT`, `POST`, `DELETE` or `HEAD`.\n* `allowed_origins` - (Required) One or more origins you want customers to be able to access the bucket from.\n* `expose_headers` - (Optional) One or more headers in the response that you want customers to be able to access from their applications (for example, from a JavaScript `XMLHttpRequest` object).\n* `max_age_seconds` - (Optional) Specifies time in seconds that browser can cache the response for a preflight request.\n\n### Grant\n\n~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `grant` configuration of *existing* resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of ACL grants to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource instead. If you use `grant` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of ACL grants for the S3 bucket, treating additional ACL grants as drift. For this reason, `grant` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_acl` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `grant` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `id` - (Optional) Canonical user id to grant for. Used only when `type` is `CanonicalUser`.\n* `type` - (Required) Type of grantee to apply for.

To manage changes of Lifecycle rules to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource instead. If you use `lifecycle_rule` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of Lifecycle rules for the S3 bucket, treating additional Lifecycle rules as drift. For this reason, `lifecycle_rule` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_lifecycle_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\n~> **NOTE:** At least one of `abort_incomplete_multipart_upload_days`, `expiration`, `transition`, `noncurrent_version_expiration`, `noncurrent_version_transition` must be specified.\n\nThe `lifecycle_rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `id` - (Optional) Unique identifier for the rule.

To manage changes of logging parameters to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_logging` resource instead. If you use `logging` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of logging parameters for the S3 bucket, treating additional logging parameters as drift. For this reason, `logging` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_logging` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `logging` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `target_bucket` - (Required) Name of the bucket that will receive the log objects.\n* `target_prefix` - (Optional) To specify a key prefix for log objects.\n\n### Object Lock Configuration\n\n~> **NOTE:** You can only **enable** S3 Object Lock for **new** buckets. If you need to **enable** S3 Object Lock for an **existing** bucket, please contact AWS Support.\nWhen you create a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, Amazon S3 automatically enables versioning for the bucket.\nOnce you create a bucket with S3 Object Lock enabled, you can't disable Object Lock or suspend versioning for the bucket.\n\n~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `object_lock_configuration` configuration of *existing* resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of Object Lock settings to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_object_lock_configuration` resource instead. If you use `object_lock_configuration` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full set of Object Lock configuration parameters for the S3 bucket, treating additional Object Lock configuration parameters as drift. For this reason, `object_lock_configuration` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_object_lock_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `object_lock_configuration` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `object_lock_enabled` - (Optional, **Deprecated**) Indicates whether this bucket has an Object Lock configuration enabled. Valid value is `Enabled`. Use the top-level argument `object_lock_enabled` instead.\n* `rule` - (Optional) Object Lock rule in place for this bucket ([documented below](#rule)).\n\n#### Rule\n\nThe `rule` configuration block supports the following argument:\n\n* `default_retention` - (Required) Default retention period that you want to apply to new objects placed in this bucket ([documented below](#default-retention)).\n\n#### Default Retention\n\nThe `default_retention` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n~> **NOTE:** Either `days` or `years` must be specified, but not both.\n\n* `mode` - (Required) Default Object Lock retention mode you want to apply to new objects placed in this bucket.

To manage replication configuration changes to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration` resource instead. If you use `replication_configuration` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the full replication configuration for the S3 bucket, treating additional replication configuration rules as drift. For this reason, `replication_configuration` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_replication_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `replication_configuration` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `role` - (Required) ARN of the IAM role for Amazon S3 to assume when replicating the objects.\n* `rules` - (Required) Specifies the rules managing the replication ([documented below](#rules)).\n\n#### Rules\n\nThe `rules` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n~> **NOTE:** Amazon S3's latest version of the replication configuration is V2, which includes the `filter` attribute for replication rules.\nWith the `filter` attribute, you can specify object filters based on the object key prefix, tags, or both to scope the objects that the rule applies to.\nReplication configuration V1 supports filtering based on only the `prefix` attribute. For backwards compatibility, Amazon S3 continues to support the V1 configuration.\n\n* `delete_marker_replication_status` - (Optional) Whether delete markers are replicated.

To manage changes in encryption of an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource instead. If you use `server_side_encryption_configuration` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the encryption configuration for the S3 bucket, treating additional encryption changes as drift. For this reason, `server_side_encryption_configuration` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_server_side_encryption_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `server_side_encryption_configuration` configuration block supports the following argument:\n\n* `rule` - (Required) Single object for server-side encryption by default configuration. (documented below)\n\nThe `rule` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `apply_server_side_encryption_by_default` - (Required) Single object for setting server-side encryption by default.

Valid values are `AES256` and `aws:kms`\n* `kms_master_key_id` - (Optional) AWS KMS master key ID used for the SSE-KMS encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of `sse_algorithm` as `aws:kms`. The default `aws/s3` AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the `sse_algorithm` is `aws:kms`.\n\n### Versioning\n\n~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `versioning` configuration of *existing* resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes of versioning state to an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource instead. If you use `versioning` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the versioning state of the S3 bucket, treating additional versioning state changes as drift. For this reason, `versioning` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_versioning` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `versioning` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `enabled` - (Optional) Enable versioning. Once you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. You can, however, suspend versioning on that bucket.\n* `mfa_delete` - (Optional) Enable MFA delete for either `Change the versioning state of your bucket` or `Permanently delete an object version`. Default is `false`. This cannot be used to toggle this setting but is available to allow managed buckets to reflect the state in AWS\n\n### Website\n\n~> **NOTE:** Currently, changes to the `website` configuration of *existing* resources cannot be automatically detected by Terraform. To manage changes to the website configuration of an S3 bucket, use the `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource instead. If you use `website` on an `aws_s3_bucket`, Terraform will assume management over the configuration of the website of the S3 bucket, treating additional website configuration changes as drift. For this reason, `website` cannot be mixed with the external `aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration` resource for a given S3 bucket.\n\nThe `website` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `index_document` - (Required, unless using `redirect_all_requests_to`) Amazon S3 returns this index document when requests are made to the root domain or any of the subfolders.\n* `error_document` - (Optional) Absolute path to the document to return in case of a 4XX error.\n* `redirect_all_requests_to` - (Optional) Hostname to redirect all website requests for this bucket to. Hostname can optionally be prefixed with a protocol (`http://` or `https://`) to use when redirecting requests. The default is the protocol that is used in the original request.\n* `routing_rules` - (Optional) JSON array containing [routing rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-properties-s3-websiteconfiguration-routingrules.html)\n  describing redirect behavior and when redirects are applied.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - Name of the bucket.\n* `arn` - ARN of the bucket. Will be of format `arn:aws:s3:::bucketname`.\n* `bucket_domain_name` - Bucket domain name.

Please refer to the [S3 endpoints reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/s3.html#s3_region) for format. Note: AWS CloudFront allows specifying an S3 region-specific endpoint when creating an S3 origin. This will prevent redirect issues from CloudFront to the S3 Origin URL. For more information, see the [Virtual Hosted-Style Requests for Other Regions](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#deprecated-global-endpoint) section in the AWS S3 User Guide.\n* `hosted_zone_id` - [Route 53 Hosted Zone ID](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande.html#s3_website_region_endpoints) for this bucket's region.\n* `region` - AWS region this bucket resides in.\n* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n* `website_endpoint` - (**Deprecated**) Website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration`](s3_bucket_website_configuration.html.markdown) instead.\n* `website_domain` - (**Deprecated**) Domain of the website endpoint, if the bucket is configured with a website. If not, this will be an empty string. This is used to create Route 53 alias records. Use the resource [`aws_s3_bucket_website_configuration`](s3_bucket_website_configuration.html.markdown) instead.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `create` - (Default `20m`)\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n- `update` - (Default `20m`)\n- `delete` - (Default `60m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 bucket using the `bucket`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_s3_bucket.bucket\n  id = \"bucket-name\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import S3 bucket using the `bucket`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_s3_bucket.bucket bucket-name\n```\n",
