For more information see\n[Amazon Connect: Getting Started](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/connect/latest/adminguide/amazon-connect-get-started.html)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_connect_hours_of_operation\" \"test\" {\n  instance_id = \"aaaaaaaa-bbbb-cccc-dddd-111111111111\"\n  name        = \"Office Hours\"\n  description = \"Monday office hours\"\n  time_zone   = \"EST\"\n\n  config {\n    day = \"MONDAY\"\n\n    end_time {\n      hours   = 23\n      minutes = 8\n    }\n\n    start_time {\n      hours   = 8\n      minutes = 0\n    }\n  }\n\n  config {\n    day = \"TUESDAY\"\n\n    end_time {\n      hours   = 21\n      minutes = 0\n    }\n\n    start_time {\n      hours   = 9\n      minutes = 0\n    }\n  }\n\n  tags = {\n    \"Name\" = \"Example Hours of Operation\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `config` - (Required) One or more config blocks which define the configuration information for the hours of operation: day, start time, and end time . Config blocks are documented below.\n* `description` - (Optional) Specifies the description of the Hours of Operation.\n* `instance_id` - (Required) Specifies the identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance.\n* `name` - (Required) Specifies the name of the Hours of Operation.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the Hours of Operation. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n* `time_zone` - (Required) Specifies the time zone of the Hours of Operation.\n\nA `config` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `day` - (Required) Specifies the day that the hours of operation applies to.\n* `end_time` - (Required) A end time block specifies the time that your contact center closes. The `end_time` is documented below.\n* `start_time` - (Required) A start time block specifies the time that your contact center opens. The `start_time` is documented below.\n\nA `end_time` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `hours` - (Required) Specifies the hour of closing.\n* `minutes` - (Required) Specifies the minute of closing.\n\nA `start_time` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `hours` - (Required) Specifies the hour of opening.\n* `minutes` - (Required) Specifies the minute of opening.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the Hours of Operation.\n* `hours_of_operation_id` - The identifier for the hours of operation.\n* `id` - The identifier of the hosting Amazon Connect Instance and identifier of the Hours of Operation separated by a colon (`:`).\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Amazon Connect Hours of Operations using the `instance_id` and `hours_of_operation_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_connect_hours_of_operation.example\n  id = \"f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Amazon Connect Hours of Operations using the `instance_id` and `hours_of_operation_id` separated by a colon (`:`). For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_connect_hours_of_operation.example f1288a1f-6193-445a-b47e-af739b2:c1d4e5f6-1b3c-1b3c-1b3c-c1d4e5f6c1d4e5\n```\n",
