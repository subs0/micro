The reservoir is not used directly by services, but applies to all services using the rule collectively.\n* `service_name` - (Required) Matches the `name` that the service uses to identify itself in segments.\n* `service_type` - (Required) Matches the `origin` that the service uses to identify its type in segments.\n* `host` - (Required) Matches the hostname from a request URL.\n* `http_method` - (Required) Matches the HTTP method of a request.\n* `url_path` - (Required) Matches the path from a request URL.\n* `version` - (Required) The version of the sampling rule format (`1` )\n* `attributes` - (Optional) Matches attributes derived from the request.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value mapping of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The name of the sampling rule.\n* `arn` - The ARN of the sampling rule.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import XRay Sampling Rules using the name. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_xray_sampling_rule.example\n  id = \"example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import XRay Sampling Rules using the name. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_xray_sampling_rule.example example\n```\n",
