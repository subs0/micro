Each control in the list has a name, input parameters, and scope. Detailed below.\n* `creation_time` - Date and time that a framework is created, in Unix format and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).\n* `deployment_status` - Deployment status of a framework. The statuses are: `CREATE_IN_PROGRESS` | `UPDATE_IN_PROGRESS` | `DELETE_IN_PROGRESS` | `COMPLETED`| `FAILED`.\n* `description` - Description of the framework.\n* `id` - ID of the framework.\n* `status` - Framework consists of one or more controls. Each control governs a resource, such as backup plans, backup selections, backup vaults, or recovery points. You can also turn AWS Config recording on or off for each resource. The statuses are: `ACTIVE`, `PARTIALLY_ACTIVE`, `INACTIVE`, `UNAVAILABLE`. For more information refer to the [AWS documentation for Framework Status](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/aws-backup/latest/devguide/API_DescribeFramework.html#Backup-DescribeFramework-response-FrameworkStatus)\n* `tags` - Metadata that helps organize the frameworks you create.\n\n### Control Attributes\n\n`control` has the following attributes:\n\n* `input_parameter` - One or more input parameter blocks. An example of a control with two parameters is: \"backup plan frequency is at least daily and the retention period is at least 1 year\". The first parameter is daily. The second parameter is 1 year. Detailed below.\n* `name` - Name of a control.\n* `scope` - Scope of a control. The control scope defines what the control will evaluate. Three examples of control scopes are: a specific backup plan, all backup plans with a specific tag, or all backup plans. Detailed below.\n\n### Input Parameter Attributes\n\n`input_parameter` has the following attributes:\n\n* `name` - Name of a parameter, for example, BackupPlanFrequency.\n* `value` - Value of parameter, for example, hourly.\n\n### Scope Attributes\n\n`scope` has the following attributes:\n\n* `compliance_resource_ids` - The ID of the only AWS resource that you want your control scope to contain.\n* `compliance_resource_types` - Describes whether the control scope includes one or more types of resources, such as EFS or RDS.\n* `tags` - Tag key-value pair applied to those AWS resources that you want to trigger an evaluation for a rule. A maximum of one key-value pair can be provided.\n",
