Detailed below.\n* `host_id` - (Optional) ID of the Dedicated Host.\n\n### filter\n\nThis block allows for complex filters. You can use one or more `filter` blocks.\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeHosts.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field. A host will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - ID of the Dedicated Host.\n* `arn` - ARN of the Dedicated Host.\n* `asset_id` - The ID of the Outpost hardware asset on which the Dedicated Host is allocated.\n* `auto_placement` - Whether auto-placement is on or off.\n* `availability_zone` - Availability Zone of the Dedicated Host.\n* `cores` - Number of cores on the Dedicated Host.\n* `host_recovery` - Whether host recovery is enabled or disabled for the Dedicated Host.\n* `instance_family` - Instance family supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, \"m5\".\n* `instance_type` - Instance type supported by the Dedicated Host. For example, \"m5.large\". If the host supports multiple instance types, no instanceType is returned.\n* `outpost_arn` - ARN of the AWS Outpost on which the Dedicated Host is allocated.\n* `owner_id` - ID of the AWS account that owns the Dedicated Host.\n* `sockets` - Number of sockets on the Dedicated Host.\n* `total_vcpus` - Total number of vCPUs on the Dedicated Host.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
