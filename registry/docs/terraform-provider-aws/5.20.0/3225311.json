For more information about pattern syntax, see [Segment rule pattern syntax](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/monitoring/CloudWatch-Evidently-segments.html#CloudWatch-Evidently-segments-syntax.html).\n* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the segment. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN of the segment.\n* `created_time` - The date and time that the segment is created.\n* `experiment_count` - The number of experiments that this segment is used in. This count includes all current experiments, not just those that are currently running.\n* `id` - The ID has the same value as the ARN of the segment.\n* `last_updated_time` - The date and time that this segment was most recently updated.\n* `launch_count` - The number of launches that this segment is used in. This count includes all current launches, not just those that are currently running.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_evidently_segment.example\n  id = \"arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Segment using the `arn`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_evidently_segment.example arn:aws:evidently:us-west-2:123456789012:segment/example\n```\n",
