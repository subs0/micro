See [route](#route) below for more details. Minimum of 1. Maximum of 20.\n* `disabled` - (Optional) When origination settings are disabled, inbound calls are not enabled for your Amazon Chime Voice Connector.\n\n### `route`\n\nOrigination routes define call distribution properties for your SIP hosts to receive inbound calls using your Amazon Chime Voice Connector. Limit: Ten origination routes for each Amazon Chime Voice Connector.\n\n* `host` - (Required) The FQDN or IP address to contact for origination traffic.\n* `port` - (Required) The designated origination route port. Defaults to `5060`.\n* `priority` - (Required) The priority associated with the host, with 1 being the highest priority. Higher priority hosts are attempted first.\n* `protocol` - (Required) The protocol to use for the origination route. Encryption-enabled Amazon Chime Voice Connectors use TCP protocol by default.\n* `weight` - (Required) The weight associated with the host. If hosts are equal in priority, calls are redistributed among them based on their relative weight.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The Amazon Chime Voice Connector ID.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default\n  id = \"abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Chime Voice Connector Origination using the `voice_connector_id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_chime_voice_connector_origination.default abcdef1ghij2klmno3pqr4\n```\n",
