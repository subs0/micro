Kinesis stream or Lambda function ARN.\n* `filter_pattern` - (Required) A valid CloudWatch Logs filter pattern for subscribing to a filtered stream of log events. Use empty string `\"\"` to match everything. For more information, see the [Amazon CloudWatch Logs User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonCloudWatch/latest/logs/FilterAndPatternSyntax.html).\n* `log_group_name` - (Required) The name of the log group to associate the subscription filter with\n* `role_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of an IAM role that grants Amazon CloudWatch Logs permissions to deliver ingested log events to the destination. If you use Lambda as a destination, you should skip this argument and use `aws_lambda_permission` resource for granting access from CloudWatch logs to the destination Lambda function.\n* `distribution` - (Optional) The method used to distribute log data to the destination. By default log data is grouped by log stream, but the grouping can be set to random for a more even distribution. This property is only applicable when the destination is an Amazon Kinesis stream. Valid values are \"Random\" and \"ByLogStream\".\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports no additional attributes.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Logs subscription filter using the log group name and subscription filter name separated by `|`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter.test_lambdafunction_logfilter\n  id = \"/aws/lambda/example_lambda_name|test_lambdafunction_logfilter\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Logs subscription filter using the log group name and subscription filter name separated by `|`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_log_subscription_filter.test_lambdafunction_logfilter /aws/lambda/example_lambda_name|test_lambdafunction_logfilter\n```\n",
