If omitted, no final snapshot will be made.\n* `kms_key_arn` - ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the cluster at rest.\n* `maintenance_window` - Weekly time range during which maintenance on the cluster is performed. Specify as a range in the format `ddd:hh24:mi-ddd:hh24:mi` (24H Clock UTC). Example: `sun:23:00-mon:01:30`.\n* `node_type` - Compute and memory capacity of the nodes in the cluster.\n* `num_replicas_per_shard` - The number of replicas to apply to each shard.\n* `num_shards` - Number of shards in the cluster.\n* `parameter_group_name` - The name of the parameter group associated with the cluster.\n* `port` - Port number on which each of the nodes accepts connections.\n* `security_group_ids` - Set of VPC Security Group ID-s associated with this cluster.\n* `shards` - Set of shards in this cluster.\n    * `name` - Name of this shard.\n    * `num_nodes` - Number of individual nodes in this shard.\n    * `slots` - Keyspace for this shard. Example: `0-16383`.\n    * `nodes` - Set of nodes in this shard.\n        * `availability_zone` - The Availability Zone in which the node resides.\n        * `create_time` - The date and time when the node was created. Example: `2022-01-01T21:00:00Z`.\n        * `name` - Name of this node.\n        * `endpoint`\n            * `address` - DNS hostname of the node.\n            * `port` - Port number that this node is listening on.\n* `snapshot_retention_limit` - The number of days for which MemoryDB retains automatic snapshots before deleting them. When set to `0`, automatic backups are disabled.\n* `snapshot_window` - Daily time range (in UTC) during which MemoryDB begins taking a daily snapshot of your shard. Example: `05:00-09:00`.\n* `sns_topic_arn` - ARN of the SNS topic to which cluster notifications are sent.\n* `subnet_group_name` -The name of the subnet group used for the cluster.\n* `tls_enabled` - When true, in-transit encryption is enabled for the cluster.\n* `tags` - Map of tags assigned to the cluster.\n",
