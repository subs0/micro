The given filters must match exactly one\nElastic IP whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) One or more name/value pairs to use as filters. There are several valid keys, for a full reference, check out the [EC2 API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAddresses.html).\n* `id` - (Optional) Allocation ID of the specific VPC EIP to retrieve. If a classic EIP is required, do NOT set `id`, only set `public_ip`\n* `public_ip` - (Optional) Public IP of the specific EIP to retrieve.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match a pair on the desired Elastic IP\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `association_id` - ID representing the association of the address with an instance in a VPC.\n* `domain` - Whether the address is for use in EC2-Classic (standard) or in a VPC (vpc).\n* `id` - If VPC Elastic IP, the allocation identifier. If EC2-Classic Elastic IP, the public IP address.\n* `instance_id` - ID of the instance that the address is associated with (if any).\n* `network_interface_id` - The ID of the network interface.\n* `network_interface_owner_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the network interface.\n* `private_ip` - Private IP address associated with the Elastic IP address.\n* `private_dns` - Private DNS associated with the Elastic IP address.\n* `public_ip` - Public IP address of Elastic IP.\n* `public_dns` - Public DNS associated with the Elastic IP address.\n* `public_ipv4_pool` - ID of an address pool.\n* `carrier_ip` - Carrier IP address.\n* `customer_owned_ipv4_pool` - The ID of a Customer Owned IP Pool. For more on customer owned IP addressed check out [Customer-owned IP addresses guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/outposts/latest/userguide/outposts-networking-components.html#ip-addressing)\n* `customer_owned_ip` - Customer Owned IP.\n* `tags` - Key-value map of tags associated with Elastic IP.\n\n~> **Note:** The data source computes the `public_dns` and `private_dns` attributes according to the [VPC DNS Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-dns.html#vpc-dns-hostnames) as they are not available with the EC2 API.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
