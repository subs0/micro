Workforces can be created using Amazon Cognito or your own OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). For private workforces created using Amazon Cognito use `cognito_member_definition`. For workforces created using your own OIDC identity provider (IdP) use `oidc_member_definition`. Do not provide input for both of these parameters in a single request. see [Member Definition](#member-definition) details below.\n* `notification_configuration` - (Optional) Configures notification of workers regarding available or expiring work items. see [Notification Configuration](#notification-configuration) details below.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n### Member Definition\n\n* `cognito_member_definition` - (Optional) The Amazon Cognito user group that is part of the work team. See [Cognito Member Definition](#cognito-member-definition) details below.\n* `oidc_member_definition` - (Optional) A list user groups that exist in your OIDC Identity Provider (IdP). One to ten groups can be used to create a single private work team. See [Cognito Member Definition](#oidc-member-definition) details below.\n\n#### Cognito Member Definition\n\n* `client_id` - (Required) An identifier for an application client. You must create the app client ID using Amazon Cognito.\n* `user_pool` - (Required) An identifier for a user pool. The user pool must be in the same region as the service that you are calling.\n* `user_group` - (Required) An identifier for a user group.\n\n#### Oidc Member Definition\n\n* `groups` - (Required) A list of comma separated strings that identifies user groups in your OIDC IdP. Each user group is made up of a group of private workers.\n\n### Notification Configuration\n\n* `notification_topic_arn` - (Required) The ARN for the SNS topic to which notifications should be published.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) assigned by AWS to this Workteam.\n* `id` - The name of the Workteam.\n* `subdomain` - The subdomain for your OIDC Identity Provider.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import SageMaker Workteams using the `workteam_name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_sagemaker_workteam.example\n  id = \"example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import SageMaker Workteams using the `workteam_name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_sagemaker_workteam.example example\n```\n",
