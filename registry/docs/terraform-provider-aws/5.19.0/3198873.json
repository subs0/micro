For more information, see the [S3 Developer Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/about-object-ownership.html).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = \"example\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls\" \"example\" {\n  bucket = aws_s3_bucket.example.id\n\n  rule {\n    object_ownership = \"BucketOwnerPreferred\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `bucket` - (Required) Name of the bucket that you want to associate this access point with.\n* `rule` - (Required) Configuration block(s) with Ownership Controls rules. Detailed below.\n\n### rule Configuration Block\n\nThe following arguments are required:\n\n* `object_ownership` - (Required) Object ownership. Valid values: `BucketOwnerPreferred`, `ObjectWriter` or `BucketOwnerEnforced`\n    * `BucketOwnerPreferred` - Objects uploaded to the bucket change ownership to the bucket owner if the objects are uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.\n    * `ObjectWriter` - Uploading account will own the object if the object is uploaded with the `bucket-owner-full-control` canned ACL.\n    * `BucketOwnerEnforced` - Bucket owner automatically owns and has full control over every object in the bucket. ACLs no longer affect permissions to data in the S3 bucket.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - S3 Bucket name.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import S3 Bucket Ownership Controls using S3 Bucket name. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example\n  id = \"my-bucket\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import S3 Bucket Ownership Controls using S3 Bucket name. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_s3_bucket_ownership_controls.example my-bucket\n```\n",
