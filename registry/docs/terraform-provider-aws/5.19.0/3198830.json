Described below.\n* `security_group_ids` - (Required) The ID of one or more security groups that you want to use to control access to this VPC.\n* `name` - (Optional) The friendly name of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\nThe `ip_address` object supports the following:\n\n* `subnet_id` - (Required) The ID of the subnet that contains the IP address.\n* `ip` - (Optional) The IP address in the subnet that you want to use for DNS queries.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - The ID of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.\n* `arn` - The ARN of the Route 53 Resolver endpoint.\n* `host_vpc_id` - The ID of the VPC that you want to create the resolver endpoint in.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `create` - (Default `10m`)\n- `update` - (Default `10m`)\n- `delete` - (Default `10m`)\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import  Route 53 Resolver endpoints using the Route 53 Resolver endpoint ID. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_route53_resolver_endpoint.foo\n  id = \"rslvr-in-abcdef01234567890\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import  Route 53 Resolver endpoints using the Route 53 Resolver endpoint ID. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_route53_resolver_endpoint.foo rslvr-in-abcdef01234567890\n```\n",
