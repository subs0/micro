See [`association_config`](#association_config-block) below for details.\n* `custom_response_body` - (Optional) Defines custom response bodies that can be referenced by `custom_response` actions. See [`custom_response_body`](#custom_response_body-block) below for details.\n* `default_action` - (Required) Action to perform if none of the `rules` contained in the WebACL match. See [`default_action`](#default_action-block) below for details.\n* `description` - (Optional) Friendly description of the WebACL.\n* `name` - (Required) Friendly name of the WebACL.\n* `rule` - (Optional) Rule blocks used to identify the web requests that you want to `allow`, `block`, or `count`. See [`rule`](#rule-block) below for details.\n* `scope` - (Required) Specifies whether this is for an AWS CloudFront distribution or for a regional application. Valid values are `CLOUDFRONT` or `REGIONAL`. To work with CloudFront, you must also specify the region `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) on the AWS provider.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of key-value pairs to associate with the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n* `token_domains` - (Optional) Specifies the domains that AWS WAF should accept in a web request token. This enables the use of tokens across multiple protected websites. When AWS WAF provides a token, it uses the domain of the AWS resource that the web ACL is protecting. If you don't specify a list of token domains, AWS WAF accepts tokens only for the domain of the protected resource. With a token domain list, AWS WAF accepts the resource's host domain plus all domains in the token domain list, including their prefixed subdomains.\n* `visibility_config` - (Required) Defines and enables Amazon CloudWatch metrics and web request sample collection. See [`visibility_config`](#visibility_config-block) below for details.\n\n### `association_config` Block\n\nThe `association_config` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `request_body` - (Optional) Customizes the request body that your protected resource forward to AWS WAF for inspection.

See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.\n\n### RateLimit `ip` Block\n\nUse the request's originating IP address as an aggregate key. Each distinct IP address contributes to the aggregation instance. When you specify an IP or forwarded IP in the custom key settings, you must also specify at least one other key to use. You can aggregate on only the IP address by specifying `IP` in your rate-based statement's `aggregate_key_type`.\n\nThe `ip` block is configured as an empty block `{}`.\n\n### RateLimit `label_namespace` Block\n\nUse the specified label namespace as an aggregate key. Each distinct fully qualified label name that has the specified label namespace contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just one label namespace as your custom key, then each label name fully defines an aggregation instance. This uses only labels that have been added to the request by rules that are evaluated before this rate-based rule in the web ACL. For information about label namespaces and names, see Label syntax and naming requirements (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/waf-rule-label-requirements.html) in the WAF Developer Guide.\n\nThe `label_namespace` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `namespace`: The namespace to use for aggregation\n\n### RateLimit `query_argument` Block\n\nUse the specified query argument as an aggregate key. Each distinct value for the named query argument contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use a single query argument as your custom key, then each value fully defines an aggregation instance.\n\nThe `query_argument` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name`: The name of the query argument to use.\n* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.\n\n### RateLimit `query_string` Block\n\nUse the request's query string as an aggregate key. Each distinct string contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the query string as your custom key, then each string fully defines an aggregation instance.\n\nThe `query_string` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.\n\n### RateLimit `uri_path` Block\n\nUse the request's URI path as an aggregate key. Each distinct URI path contributes to the aggregation instance. If you use just the URI path as your custom key, then each URI path fully defines an aggregation instance.\n\nThe `uri_path` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `text_transformation`: Text transformations eliminate some of the unusual formatting that attackers use in web requests in an effort to bypass detection. They are used in rate-based rule statements, to transform request components before using them as custom aggregation keys. Atleast one transformation is required. See [`text_transformation`](#text_transformation-block) above for details.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN of the WAF WebACL.\n* `capacity` - Web ACL capacity units (WCUs) currently being used by this web ACL.\n* `id` - The ID of the WAF WebACL.\n* `tags_all` - Map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import WAFv2 Web ACLs using `ID/Name/Scope`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_wafv2_web_acl.example\n  id = \"a1b2c3d4-d5f6-7777-8888-9999aaaabbbbcccc/example/REGIONAL\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import WAFv2 Web ACLs using `ID/Name/Scope`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_wafv2_web_acl.example a1b2c3d4-d5f6-7777-8888-9999aaaabbbbcccc/example/REGIONAL\n```\n",
