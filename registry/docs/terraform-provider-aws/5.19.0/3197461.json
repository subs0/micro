To retrieve a list of Dev Environment IDs, use [ListDevEnvironments](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/codecatalyst/latest/APIReference/API_ListDevEnvironments.html).\n* `project_name` - (Required) The name of the project in the space.\n* `space_name` - (Required) The name of the space.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `alias` - The user-specified alias for the Dev Environment.\n* `creator_id` - The system-generated unique ID of the user who created the Dev Environment.\n* `ides` - Information about the integrated development environment (IDE) configured for a Dev Environment.\n* `inactivity_timeout_minutes` - The amount of time the Dev Environment will run without any activity detected before stopping, in minutes. Only whole integers are allowed. Dev Environments consume compute minutes when running.\n* `instance_type` - The Amazon EC2 instace type to use for the Dev Environment.\n* `last_updated_time` - The time when the Dev Environment was last updated, in coordinated universal time (UTC) timestamp format as specified in [RFC 3339](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc3339#section-5.6).\n* `persistent_storage` - Information about the amount of storage allocated to the Dev Environment.\n* `repositories` - The source repository that contains the branch to clone into the Dev Environment.\n* `status` - The current status of the Dev Environment.
