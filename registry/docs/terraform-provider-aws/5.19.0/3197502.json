A value of true represents an instance with a public IP address. A value of false represents an instance with a private IP address.\n* `replication_instance_arn` - The Amazon Resource Name (ARN) of the replication instance.\n* `replication_instance_class` - The compute and memory capacity of the replication instance as specified by the replication instance class. See [AWS DMS User Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/dms/latest/userguide/CHAP_ReplicationInstance.Types.html) for information on instance classes.\n* `replication_instance_private_ips` - A list of the private IP addresses of the replication instance.\n* `replication_instance_public_ips` - A list of the public IP addresses of the replication instance.\n* `replication_subnet_group_id` - A subnet group to associate with the replication instance.\n* `vpc_security_group_ids` - A set of VPC security group IDs that are used with the replication instance.\n",
