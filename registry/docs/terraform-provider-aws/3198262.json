For single account associations, see the [`aws_dx_gateway_association` resource](/docs/providers/aws/r/dx_gateway_association.html).\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal\" \"example\" {\n  dx_gateway_id               = aws_dx_gateway.example.id\n  dx_gateway_owner_account_id = aws_dx_gateway.example.owner_account_id\n  associated_gateway_id       = aws_vpn_gateway.example.id\n}\n```\n\nA full example of how to create a VPN Gateway in one AWS account, create a Direct Connect Gateway in a second AWS account, and associate the VPN Gateway with the Direct Connect Gateway via the `aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` and `aws_dx_gateway_association` resources can be found in [the `./examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association` directory within the Github Repository](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-aws/tree/main/examples/dx-gateway-cross-account-vgw-association).\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `associated_gateway_id` - (Required) The ID of the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.\n* `dx_gateway_id` - (Required) Direct Connect Gateway identifier.\n* `dx_gateway_owner_account_id` - (Required) AWS Account identifier of the Direct Connect Gateway's owner.\n* `allowed_prefixes` - (Optional) VPC prefixes (CIDRs) to advertise to the Direct Connect gateway. Defaults to the CIDR block of the VPC associated with the Virtual Gateway. To enable drift detection, must be configured.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - Direct Connect Gateway Association Proposal identifier.\n* `associated_gateway_owner_account_id` - The ID of the AWS account that owns the VGW or transit gateway with which to associate the Direct Connect gateway.\n* `associated_gateway_type` - The type of the associated gateway, `transitGateway` or `virtualPrivateGateway`.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Direct Connect Gateway Association Proposals using either a proposal ID or proposal ID, Direct Connect Gateway ID and associated gateway ID separated by `/`. For example:\n\nUsing a proposal ID:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal.example\n  id = \"ac90e981-b718-4364-872d-65478c84fafe\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing a proposal ID, Direct Connect Gateway ID and associated gateway ID separated by `/`:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal.example\n  id = \"ac90e981-b718-4364-872d-65478c84fafe/abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45/vgw-12345678\"\n}\n```\n\n**With `terraform import`**, import Direct Connect Gateway Association Proposals using either a proposal ID or proposal ID, Direct Connect Gateway ID and associated gateway ID separated by `/`. For example:\n\nUsing a proposal ID:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal.example ac90e981-b718-4364-872d-65478c84fafe\n```\n\nUsing a proposal ID, Direct Connect Gateway ID and associated gateway ID separated by `/`:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal.example ac90e981-b718-4364-872d-65478c84fafe/abcd1234-dcba-5678-be23-cdef9876ab45/vgw-12345678\n```\n\nThe latter case is useful when a previous proposal has been accepted and deleted by AWS.\nThe `aws_dx_gateway_association_proposal` resource will then represent a pseudo-proposal for the same Direct Connect Gateway and associated gateway. If no previous proposal is available, use a tool like [`uuidgen`](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/bionic/man1/uuidgen.1.html) to generate a new random pseudo-proposal ID.\n",
