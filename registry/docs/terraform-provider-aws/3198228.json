See [AWS Device Farm endpoints and quotas](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/devicefarm.html) for information on supported regions.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_devicefarm_project\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"example\"\n}\n\nresource \"aws_devicefarm_network_profile\" \"example\" {\n  name        = \"example\"\n  project_arn = aws_devicefarm_project.example.arn\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\n* `description` - (Optional) The description of the network profile.\n* `downlink_bandwidth_bits` - (Optional) The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from `0` to `104857600`. Default value is `104857600`.\n* `downlink_delay_ms` - (Optional) Delay time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an integer from `0` to `2000`.\n* `downlink_jitter_ms` - (Optional) Time variation in the delay of received packets in milliseconds as an integer from `0` to `2000`.\n* `downlink_loss_percent` - (Optional) Proportion of received packets that fail to arrive from `0` to `100` percent.\n* `name` - (Required) The name for the network profile.\n* `uplink_bandwidth_bits` - (Optional) The data throughput rate in bits per second, as an integer from `0` to `104857600`. Default value is `104857600`.\n* `uplink_delay_ms` - (Optional) Delay time for all packets to destination in milliseconds as an integer from `0` to `2000`.\n* `uplink_jitter_ms` - (Optional) Time variation in the delay of received packets in milliseconds as an integer from `0` to `2000`.\n* `uplink_loss_percent` - (Optional) Proportion of received packets that fail to arrive from `0` to `100` percent.\n* `project_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the project for the network profile.\n* `type` - (Optional) The type of network profile to create. Valid values are listed are `PRIVATE` and `CURATED`.\n* `tags` - (Optional) A map of tags to assign to the resource. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The Amazon Resource Name of this network profile.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import DeviceFarm Network Profiles using their ARN. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_devicefarm_network_profile.example\n  id = \"arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:networkprofile:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import DeviceFarm Network Profiles using their ARN. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_devicefarm_network_profile.example arn:aws:devicefarm:us-west-2:123456789012:networkprofile:4fa784c7-ccb4-4dbf-ba4f-02198320daa1\n```\n",
