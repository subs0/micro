See below.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Key-value map of resource tags. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n\n### Nested Fields\n\n#### `player_latency_policy`\n\n* `maximum_individual_player_latency_milliseconds` - (Required) Maximum latency value that is allowed for any player.\n* `policy_duration_seconds` - (Optional) Length of time that the policy is enforced while placing a new game session. Absence of value for this attribute means that the policy is enforced until the queue times out.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - Game Session Queue ARN.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs#default_tags-configuration-block).\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.example\n  id = \"example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import GameLift Game Session Queues using their `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_gamelift_game_session_queue.example example\n```\n",
