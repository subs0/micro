The given filters must match exactly one\nInternet Gateway whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `internet_gateway_id` - (Optional) ID of the specific Internet Gateway to retrieve.\n\n* `tags` - (Optional) Map of tags, each pair of which must exactly match\n  a pair on the desired Internet Gateway.\n\n* `filter` - (Optional) Custom filter block as described below.\n\nMore complex filters can be expressed using one or more `filter` sub-blocks,\nwhich take the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the field to filter by, as defined by\n  [the underlying AWS API](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeInternetGateways.html).\n\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given field.\n  An Internet Gateway will be selected if any one of the given values matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - ARN of the Internet Gateway.\n\nAll of the argument attributes except `filter` block are also exported as\nresult attributes. This data source will complete the data by populating\nany fields that are not included in the configuration with the data for\nthe selected Internet Gateway.\n\n`attachments` are also exported with the following attributes, when there are relevants:\nEach attachment supports the following:\n\n* `owner_id` - ID of the AWS account that owns the internet gateway.\n* `state` - Current state of the attachment between the gateway and the VPC. Present only if a VPC is attached\n* `vpc_id` - ID of an attached VPC.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
