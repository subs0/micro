Useful if you wish to reuse the default baselines provided.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nTo retrieve a baseline provided by AWS:\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_ssm_patch_baseline\" \"centos\" {\n  owner            = \"AWS\"\n  name_prefix      = \"AWS-\"\n  operating_system = \"CENTOS\"\n}\n```\n\nTo retrieve a baseline on your account:\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_ssm_patch_baseline\" \"default_custom\" {\n  owner            = \"Self\"\n  name_prefix      = \"MyCustomBaseline\"\n  default_baseline = true\n  operating_system = \"WINDOWS\"\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis data source supports the following arguments:\n\n* `owner` - (Required) Owner of the baseline. Valid values: `All`, `AWS`, `Self` (the current account).\n* `name_prefix` - (Optional) Filter results by the baseline name prefix.\n* `default_baseline` - (Optional) Filters the results against the baselines default_baseline field.\n* `operating_system` - (Optional) Specified OS for the baseline. Valid values: `AMAZON_LINUX`, `AMAZON_LINUX_2`, `UBUNTU`, `REDHAT_ENTERPRISE_LINUX`, `SUSE`, `CENTOS`, `ORACLE_LINUX`, `DEBIAN`, `MACOS`, `RASPBIAN` and `ROCKY_LINUX`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `approved_patches` - List of explicitly approved patches for the baseline.\n* `approved_patches_compliance_level` - The compliance level for approved patches.\n* `approved_patches_enable_non_security` - Indicates whether the list of approved patches includes non-security updates that should be applied to the instances.\n* `approval_rule` - List of rules used to include patches in the baseline.\n    * `approve_after_days` - The number of days after the release date of each patch matched by the rule the patch is marked as approved in the patch baseline.\n    * `approve_until_date` - The cutoff date for auto approval of released patches. Any patches released on or before this date are installed automatically. Date is formatted as `YYYY-MM-DD`. Conflicts with `approve_after_days`\n    * `compliance_level` - The compliance level for patches approved by this rule.\n    * `enable_non_security` - Boolean enabling the application of non-security updates.\n    * `patch_filter` - The patch filter group that defines the criteria for the rule.\n        * `key` - The key for the filter.\n        * `values` - The value for the filter.\n* `global_filter` - Set of global filters used to exclude patches from the baseline.\n    * `key` - The key for the filter.\n    * `values` - The value for the filter.\n* `id` - ID of the baseline.\n* `name` - Name of the baseline.\n* `description` - Description of the baseline.\n* `rejected_patches` - List of rejected patches.\n* `rejected_patches_action` - The action specified to take on patches included in the `rejected_patches` list.\n* `source` - Information about the patches to use to update the managed nodes, including target operating systems and source repositories.\n    * `configuration` - The value of the yum repo configuration.\n    * `name` - The name specified to identify the patch source.\n    * `products` - The specific operating system versions a patch repository applies to.\n",
