Amazon Detective adds this message to the standard content that it sends for an invitation.\n* `disable_email_notification` - (Optional) If set to true, then the root user of the invited account will _not_ receive an email notification. This notification is in addition to an alert that the root user receives in AWS Personal Health Dashboard. By default, this is set to `false`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `id` - Unique identifier (ID) of the Detective.\n* `status` - Current membership status of the member account.\n* `administrator_id` - AWS account ID for the administrator account.\n* `volume_usage_in_bytes` - Data volume in bytes per day for the member account.\n* `invited_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, when an Amazon Detective membership invitation was last sent to the account.\n* `updated_time` - Date and time, in UTC and extended RFC 3339 format, of the most recent change to the member account's status.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import `aws_detective_member` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_detective_member.example\n  id = \"arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d/123456789012\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import `aws_detective_member` using the ARN of the graph followed by the account ID of the member account. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_detective_member.example arn:aws:detective:us-east-1:123456789101:graph:231684d34gh74g4bae1dbc7bd807d02d/123456789012\n```\n",
