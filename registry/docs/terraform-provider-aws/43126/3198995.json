See [Source](#source) below for details.\n* `destination` - (Required) The S3 bucket in which to save your signed object. See [Destination](#destination) below for details.\n* `ignore_signing_job_failure` - (Optional) Set this argument to `true` to ignore signing job failures and retrieve failed status and reason. Default `false`.\n\n### Source\n\nThe source configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `s3` - (Required) A configuration block describing the S3 Source object: See [S3 Source](#s3-source) below for details.\n\n### S3 Source\n\nThe configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `bucket` - (Required) Name of the S3 bucket.\n* `key` - (Required) Key name of the object that contains your unsigned code.\n* `version` - (Required) Version of your source image in your version enabled S3 bucket.\n\n### Destination\n\nThe destination configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `s3` - (Required) A configuration block describing the S3 Destination object: See [S3 Destination](#s3-destination) below for details.\n\n### S3 Destination\n\nThe configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `bucket` - (Required) Name of the S3 bucket.\n* `prefix` - (Optional) An Amazon S3 object key prefix that you can use to limit signed objects keys to begin with the specified prefix.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `completed_at` - Date and time in [RFC3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) that the signing job was completed.\n* `created_at` - Date and time in [RFC3339 format](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339#section-5.8) that the signing job was created.\n* `job_id` - The ID of the signing job on output.\n* `job_invoker` - The IAM entity that initiated the signing job.\n* `job_owner` - The AWS account ID of the job owner.\n* `platform_display_name` - A human-readable name for the signing platform associated with the signing job.\n* `platform_id` - The platform to which your signed code image will be distributed.\n* `profile_version` - The version of the signing profile used to initiate the signing job.\n* `requested_by` - The IAM principal that requested the signing job.\n* `revocation_record` - A revocation record if the signature generated by the signing job has been revoked. Contains a timestamp and the ID of the IAM entity that revoked the signature.\n* `signature_expires_at` - The time when the signature of a signing job expires.\n* `signed_object` - Name of the S3 bucket where the signed code image is saved by code signing.\n* `status` - Status of the signing job.\n* `status_reason` - String value that contains the status reason.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import Signer signing jobs using the `job_id`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_signer_signing_job.test_signer_signing_job\n  id = \"9ed7e5c3-b8d4-4da0-8459-44e0b068f7ee\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import Signer signing jobs using the `job_id`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_signer_signing_job.test_signer_signing_job 9ed7e5c3-b8d4-4da0-8459-44e0b068f7ee\n```\n",
