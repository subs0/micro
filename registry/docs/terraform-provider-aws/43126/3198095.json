The functionality is identical.\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\nresource \"aws_cloudwatch_event_endpoint\" \"this\" {\n  name     = \"global-endpoint\"\n  role_arn = aws_iam_role.replication.arn\n\n  event_bus {\n    event_bus_arn = aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.primary.arn\n  }\n  event_bus {\n    event_bus_arn = aws_cloudwatch_event_bus.secondary.arn\n  }\n\n  replication_config {\n    state = \"DISABLED\"\n  }\n\n  routing_config {\n    failover_config {\n      primary {\n        health_check = aws_route53_health_check.primary.arn\n      }\n\n      secondary {\n        route = \"us-east-2\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThis resource supports the following arguments:\n\n* `description` - (Optional) A description of the global endpoint.\n* `event_bus` - (Required) The event buses to use. The names of the event buses must be identical in each Region. Exactly two event buses are required. Documented below.\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the global endpoint.\n* `replication_config` - (Optional) Parameters used for replication. Documented below.\n* `role_arn` - (Optional) The ARN of the IAM role used for replication between event buses.\n* `routing_config` - (Required) Parameters used for routing, including the health check and secondary Region. Documented below.\n\n`event_bus` supports the following:\n\n* `event_bus_arn` - (Required) The ARN of the event bus the endpoint is associated with.\n\n`replication_config` supports the following:\n\n* `state` - (Optional) The state of event replication. Valid values: `ENABLED`, `DISABLED`. The default state is `ENABLED`, which means you must supply a `role_arn`. If you don't have a `role_arn` or you don't want event replication enabled, set `state` to `DISABLED`.\n\n`routing_config` support the following:\n\n* `failover_config` - (Required) Parameters used for failover. This includes what triggers failover and what happens when it's triggered. Documented below.\n\n`failover_config` support the following:\n\n* `primary` - (Required) Parameters used for the primary Region. Documented below.\n* `secondary` - (Required) Parameters used for the secondary Region, the Region that events are routed to when failover is triggered or event replication is enabled. Documented below.\n\n`primary` support the following:\n\n* `health_check` - (Required) The ARN of the health check used by the endpoint to determine whether failover is triggered.\n\n`secondary` support the following:\n\n* `route` - (Required) The name of the secondary Region.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN of the endpoint that was created.\n* `endpoint_url` - The URL of the endpoint that was created.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import EventBridge Global Endpoints using the `name`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_cloudwatch_event_endpoint.imported_endpoint\n  id = \"example-endpoint\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import EventBridge Global Endpoints using the `name`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_cloudwatch_event_endpoint.imported_endpoint example-endpoint\n```\n",
