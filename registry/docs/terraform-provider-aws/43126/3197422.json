The latter may be useful e.g., for implementing a\nconsistent subnet numbering scheme across several regions by mapping both\nthe region and the subnet letter to network numbers.\n\nThis is different from the `aws_availability_zones` (plural) data source,\nwhich provides a list of the available zones.\n\n## Example Usage\n\nThe following example shows how this data source might be used to derive\nVPC and subnet CIDR prefixes systematically for an availability zone.\n\n```terraform\nvariable \"region_number\" {\n  # Arbitrary mapping of region name to number to use in\n  # a VPC's CIDR prefix.\n  default = {\n    us-east-1      = 1\n    us-west-1      = 2\n    us-west-2      = 3\n    eu-central-1   = 4\n    ap-northeast-1 = 5\n  }\n}\n\nvariable \"az_number\" {\n  # Assign a number to each AZ letter used in our configuration\n  default = {\n    a = 1\n    b = 2\n    c = 3\n    d = 4\n    e = 5\n    f = 6\n  }\n}\n\n# Retrieve the AZ where we want to create network resources\n# This must be in the region selected on the AWS provider.\ndata \"aws_availability_zone\" \"example\" {\n  name = \"eu-central-1a\"\n}\n\n# Create a VPC for the region associated with the AZ\nresource \"aws_vpc\" \"example\" {\n  cidr_block = cidrsubnet(\"10.0.0.0/8\", 4, var.region_number[data.aws_availability_zone.example.region])\n}\n\n# Create a subnet for the AZ within the regional VPC\nresource \"aws_subnet\" \"example\" {\n  vpc_id     = aws_vpc.example.id\n  cidr_block = cidrsubnet(aws_vpc.example.cidr_block, 4, var.az_number[data.aws_availability_zone.example.name_suffix])\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\nThe arguments of this data source act as filters for querying the available\navailability zones. The given filters must match exactly one availability\nzone whose data will be exported as attributes.\n\n* `all_availability_zones` - (Optional) Set to `true` to include all Availability Zones and Local Zones regardless of your opt in status.\n* `filter` - (Optional) Configuration block(s) for filtering. Detailed below.\n* `name` - (Optional) Full name of the availability zone to select.\n* `state` - (Optional) Specific availability zone state to require. May be any of `\"available\"`, `\"information\"` or `\"impaired\"`.\n* `zone_id` - (Optional) Zone ID of the availability zone to select.\n\n### filter Configuration Block\n\nThe `filter` configuration block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) Name of the filter field. Valid values can be found in the [EC2 DescribeAvailabilityZones API Reference](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/APIReference/API_DescribeAvailabilityZones.html).\n* `values` - (Required) Set of values that are accepted for the given filter field. Results will be selected if any given value matches.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `group_name` - For Availability Zones, this is the same value as the Region name. For Local Zones, the name of the associated group, for example `us-west-2-lax-1`.\n* `name_suffix` - Part of the AZ name that appears after the region name, uniquely identifying the AZ within its region.\nFor Availability Zones this is usually a single letter, for example `a` for the `us-west-2a` zone.\nFor Local and Wavelength Zones this is a longer string, for example `wl1-sfo-wlz-1` for the `us-west-2-wl1-sfo-wlz-1` zone.\n* `network_border_group` - The name of the location from which the address is advertised.\n* `opt_in_status` - For Availability Zones, this always has the value of `opt-in-not-required`. For Local Zones, this is the opt in status. The possible values are `opted-in` and `not-opted-in`.\n* `parent_zone_id` - ID of the zone that handles some of the Local Zone or Wavelength Zone control plane operations, such as API calls.\n* `parent_zone_name` - Name of the zone that handles some of the Local Zone or Wavelength Zone control plane operations, such as API calls.\n* `region` - Region where the selected availability zone resides. This is always the region selected on the provider, since this data source searches only within that region.\n* `zone_type` - Type of zone. Values are `availability-zone`, `local-zone`, and `wavelength-zone`.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/resources/syntax#operation-timeouts):\n\n- `read` - (Default `20m`)\n",
