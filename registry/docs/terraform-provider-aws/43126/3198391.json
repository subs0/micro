The default variation is served to users who are not allocated to any ongoing launches or experiments of this feature. This variation must also be listed in the `variations` structure. If you omit `default_variation`, the first variation listed in the `variations` structure is used as the default variation.\n* `description` - (Optional) Specifies the description of the feature.\n* `entity_overrides` - (Optional) Specify users that should always be served a specific variation of a feature. Each user is specified by a key-value pair . For each key, specify a user by entering their user ID, account ID, or some other identifier. For the value, specify the name of the variation that they are to be served.\n* `evaluation_strategy` - (Optional) Specify `ALL_RULES` to activate the traffic allocation specified by any ongoing launches or experiments. Specify `DEFAULT_VARIATION` to serve the default variation to all users instead.\n* `name` - (Required) The name for the new feature. Minimum length of `1`. Maximum length of `127`.\n* `project` - (Required) The name or ARN of the project that is to contain the new feature.\n* `tags` - (Optional) Tags to apply to the feature. If configured with a provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block) present, tags with matching keys will overwrite those defined at the provider-level.\n* `variations` - (Required) One or more blocks that contain the configuration of the feature's different variations. [Detailed below](#variations)\n\n### `variations`\n\nThe `variations` block supports the following arguments:\n\n* `name` - (Required) The name of the variation. Minimum length of `1`. Maximum length of `127`.\n* `value` - (Required) A block that specifies the value assigned to this variation. [Detailed below](#value)\n\n#### `value`\n\nThe `value` block supports the following arguments:\n\n~> **NOTE:** You must specify exactly one of `bool_value`, `double_value`, `long_value`, `string_value`.\n\n* `bool_value` - (Optional) If this feature uses the Boolean variation type, this field contains the Boolean value of this variation.\n* `double_value` - (Optional) If this feature uses the double integer variation type, this field contains the double integer value of this variation.\n* `long_value` - (Optional) If this feature uses the long variation type, this field contains the long value of this variation. Minimum value of `-9007199254740991`. Maximum value of `9007199254740991`.\n* `string_value` - (Optional) If this feature uses the string variation type, this field contains the string value of this variation. Minimum length of `0`. Maximum length of `512`.\n\n## Timeouts\n\n[Configuration options](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/blocks/resources/syntax.html#operation-timeouts):\n\n* `create` - (Default `2m`)\n* `delete` - (Default `2m`)\n* `update` - (Default `2m`)\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis resource exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `arn` - The ARN of the feature.\n* `created_time` - The date and time that the feature is created.\n* `evaluation_rules` - One or more blocks that define the evaluation rules for the feature. [Detailed below](#evaluation_rules)\n* `id` - The feature `name` and the project `name` or `arn` separated by a colon (`:`).\n* `last_updated_time` - The date and time that the feature was most recently updated.\n* `status` - The current state of the feature. Valid values are `AVAILABLE` and `UPDATING`.\n* `tags_all` - A map of tags assigned to the resource, including those inherited from the provider [`default_tags` configuration block](/docs/providers/aws/index.html#default_tags-configuration-block).\n* `value_type` - Defines the type of value used to define the different feature variations. Valid Values: `STRING`, `LONG`, `DOUBLE`, `BOOLEAN`.\n\n### `evaluation_rules`\n\nThe `evaluation_rules` block supports the following attributes:\n\n* `name` - The name of the experiment or launch.\n* `type` - This value is `aws.evidently.splits` if this is an evaluation rule for a launch, and it is `aws.evidently.onlineab` if this is an evaluation rule for an experiment.\n\n## Import\n\nIn Terraform v1.5.0 and later, use an [`import` block](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/import) to import CloudWatch Evidently Feature using the feature `name` and `name` or `arn` of the hosting CloudWatch Evidently Project separated by a `:`. For example:\n\n```terraform\nimport {\n  to = aws_evidently_feature.example\n  id = \"exampleFeatureName:arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:project/example\"\n}\n```\n\nUsing `terraform import`, import CloudWatch Evidently Feature using the feature `name` and `name` or `arn` of the hosting CloudWatch Evidently Project separated by a `:`. For example:\n\n```console\n% terraform import aws_evidently_feature.example exampleFeatureName:arn:aws:evidently:us-east-1:123456789012:project/example\n```\n",
