You can fix the problem two ways: 1) updating the function's role to another role and then updating it back again to the recreated role, or 2) by using Terraform to `taint` the function and `apply` your configuration again to recreate the function. (When you create a function, Lambda grants permissions on the KMS key to the function's IAM role. If the IAM role is recreated, the grant is no longer valid. Changing the function's role or recreating the function causes Lambda to update the grant.)\n\n## Example Usage\n\n```terraform\ndata \"aws_lambda_invocation\" \"example\" {\n  function_name = aws_lambda_function.lambda_function_test.function_name\n\n  input = <<JSON\n{\n  \"key1\": \"value1\",\n  \"key2\": \"value2\"\n}\nJSON\n}\n\noutput \"result_entry\" {\n  value = jsondecode(data.aws_lambda_invocation.example.result)[\"key1\"]\n}\n```\n\n## Argument Reference\n\n* `function_name` - (Required) Name of the lambda function.\n* `input` - (Required) String in JSON format that is passed as payload to the lambda function.\n* `qualifier` - (Optional) Qualifier (a.k.a version) of the lambda function. Defaults\n to `$LATEST`.\n\n## Attribute Reference\n\nThis data source exports the following attributes in addition to the arguments above:\n\n* `result` - String result of the lambda function invocation.\n",
