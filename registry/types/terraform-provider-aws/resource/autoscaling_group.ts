~> **NOTE:** A refresh will not start when `version = "$Latest"` is configured in the `launch_template` block. To trigger the instance refresh when a launch template is changed, configure `version` to use the `latest_version` attribute of the `aws_launch_template` resource.

~> **NOTE:** Auto Scaling Groups support up to one active instance refresh at a time. When this resource is updated, any existing refresh is cancelled.

~> **NOTE:** Depending on health check settings and group size, an instance refresh may take a long time or fail. This resource does not wait for the instance refresh to complete. */
