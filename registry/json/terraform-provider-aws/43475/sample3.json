For example a `tag` of `stage = “test”`, will map to a segment named `test`. The value must exactly match the name of a segment. This allows you to have many segments, but use only a single rule without having to define multiple nearly identical conditions. This prevents creating many similar conditions that all use the same keys to map to segments.",
            "require_acceptance": "(Optional) Determines if this mapping should override the segment value for `require_attachment_acceptance`. You can only set this to `true`, indicating that this setting applies only to segments that have `require_attachment_acceptance` set to `false`. If the segment already has the default `require_attachment_acceptance`, you can set this to inherit segment’s acceptance value.\n\n### `conditions`\n\nThe conditions block has 4 arguments `type`, `operator`, `key`, `value`. Setting or omitting each argument requires a combination of logic based on the value set to `type`.

By default, the core network automatically assigns an ASN for each Core Network Edge but you can optionally define the ASN in the edge-locations for each Region. The ASN uses an array of integer ranges only from `64512` to `65534` and `4200000000` to `4294967294` expressed as a string like `\"64512-65534\"`. No other ASN ranges can be used.",

            "allow_filter": "(Optional)  List of strings of segment names that explicitly allows only routes from the segments that are listed in the array. Use the `allow_filter` setting if a segment has a well-defined group of other segments that connectivity should be restricted to. It is applied after routes have been shared in `segment_actions`. If a segment is listed in `allow_filter`, attachments between the two segments will have routes if they are also shared in the segment-actions area. For example, you might have a segment named \"video-producer\" that should only ever share routes with a \"video-distributor\" segment, no matter how many other share statements are created.",
            "deny_filter": "(Optional) An array of segments that disallows routes from the segments listed in the array. It is applied only after routes have been shared in `segment_actions`. If a segment is listed in the `deny_filter`, attachments between the two segments will never have routes shared across them. For example, you might have a \"financial\" payment segment that should never share routes with a \"development\" segment, regardless of how many other share statements are created. Adding the payments segment to the deny-filter parameter prevents any shared routes from being created with other segments.",
            "isolate_attachments": "(Optional) This Boolean setting determines whether attachments on the same segment can communicate with each other. If set to `true`, the only routes available will be either shared routes through the share actions, which are attachments in other segments, or static routes. The default value is `false`. For example, you might have a segment dedicated to \"development\" that should never allow VPCs to talk to each other, even if they’re on the same segment. In this example, you would keep the default parameter of `false`.",
            "name": "(Required) Unique name for a segment. The name is a string used in other parts of the policy document, as well as in the console for metrics and other reference points. Valid characters are a-z, and 0-9.",
            "require_attachment_acceptance": "(Optional) This Boolean setting determines whether attachment requests are automatically approved or require acceptance. The default is `true`, indicating that attachment requests require acceptance. For example, you might use this setting to allow a \"sandbox\" segment to allow any attachment request so that a core network or attachment administrator does not need to review and approve attachment requests. In this example, `require_attachment_acceptance` is set to `false`.\n\n### `segment_actions`\n\n`segment_actions` have differnet outcomes based on their `action` argument value. There are 2 valid values for `action`: `create-route` & `share`. Behaviors of the below arguments changed depending on the `action` you specify.

The default value is `0.05`, which means 5 percent of stripe size. For the default values of 64 MiB ORC stripes and 256 MiB HDFS blocks, the default block padding tolerance of 5 percent reserves a maximum of 3.2 MiB for padding within the 256 MiB block. In such a case, if the available size within the block is more than 3.2 MiB, a new, smaller stripe is inserted to fit within that space. This ensures that no stripe crosses block boundaries and causes remote reads within a node-local task. Kinesis Data Firehose ignores this parameter when `enable_padding` is `false`.",
